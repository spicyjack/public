00:00:44,504 --> 00:00:45,879
Next.

3
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:48,733
May I?

4
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:49,950
Yes.

5
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:53,104
What's the complaint?

6
00:00:53,646 --> 00:00:54,700
You know, a cough.

7
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,250
A cough? Strong?

8
00:00:57,583 --> 00:00:58,500
Yes.

9
00:00:58,550 --> 00:00:59,986
Dry or with phlegm?

10
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:01,095
Dry.

11
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:02,930
Almost gasping.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,460
OK, I understand.

13
00:01:07,393 --> 00:01:09,520
Undressed? Go to the platform.

14
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,188
Do you smoke?

15
00:01:11,647 --> 00:01:12,231
Yes.

16
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:13,791
A lot?

17
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:15,326
Yes.

18
00:01:16,828 --> 00:01:20,164
oh, oh, oh, you need to quit smoking.

19
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,699
Yeah, I need to.

20
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,088
Inhale.

21
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:27,922
Hold your breath.

22
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,667
You can breathe now

23
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,460
Bronchial obstruction...

24
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:11,047
Pneumonia...

25
00:02:58,326 --> 00:03:02,900
Moscow, 1955

26
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,300
Ivan, Klim, Nikolai...

27
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,000
Come from that side.

28
00:04:36,272 --> 00:04:37,274
Elena, Slava - here.

29
00:04:41,194 --> 00:04:42,594
Luba, give me the tool.

30
00:05:43,755 --> 00:05:45,257
Round-up!!!

31
00:05:45,674 --> 00:05:46,256
Run!!!

32
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,193
Cut-cut-cut!

33
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,163
Mels!

34
00:07:36,393 --> 00:07:37,162
Can you walk?

35
00:07:38,423 --> 00:07:40,134
It hurts!

36
00:07:41,786 --> 00:07:42,704
Can you walk?

37
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,192
Wait, I'm going for the others.

38
00:07:51,226 --> 00:07:52,130
No need.

39
00:07:59,654 --> 00:08:01,278
Probably broke my leg.

40
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,049
All because of you.

41
00:08:13,658 --> 00:08:14,239
oh, well...

42
00:08:17,876 --> 00:08:18,392
Stand-up.

43
00:08:19,386 --> 00:08:21,304
Stand-up, Stand-up.

44
00:08:24,812 --> 00:08:26,224
What's your name?

45
00:08:27,618 --> 00:08:28,598
Mels.

46
00:08:29,617 --> 00:08:30,591
And you?

47
00:08:31,445 --> 00:08:32,839
Polina.

48
00:08:35,488 --> 00:08:36,419
Polly.

49
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:45,049
For those who know, (Polza) "Advantage"

50
00:08:47,425 --> 00:08:48,325
Why "Advantage"?

51
00:08:50,688 --> 00:08:51,458
You'll see.

52
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,277
Now, you know.

53
00:09:01,883 --> 00:09:05,283
Come to Broadway.
It will be to your <i>advantage!

54
00:09:15,753 --> 00:09:17,350
What a night ....

55
00:09:18,883 --> 00:09:21,874
Why do people not want to 
live like everyone else?

56
00:09:24,758 --> 00:09:26,973
OK.  How could this happen, Mels?

57
00:09:32,885 --> 00:09:34,367
I didn't catch up.

58
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,942
You? Champion of the faculty!

59
00:09:39,397 --> 00:09:41,355
I'm telling you, Katya ...

60
00:09:42,097 --> 00:09:44,044
I tripped and fell into the water.

61
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,700
It can happen to anybody.

62
00:09:45,926 --> 00:09:50,464
It's not that, I don't understand how 
you casually say, "didn't catch up"?

63
00:09:51,236 --> 00:09:52,790
We're not here to play
the game, "tag" Mels.

64
00:09:52,955 --> 00:09:55,160
Every dandy - is a potential criminal.

65
00:09:55,643 --> 00:09:57,557
From saxophone to knife - just one step!

66
00:09:57,557 --> 00:09:59,107
You know what, Kommisar...

67
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,180
Tomorrow I'll write a report ...

68
00:10:02,951 --> 00:10:06,430
how I ran, how I stumbled, how I fell into the water.

69
00:10:06,575 --> 00:10:10,212
Don't worry, Mels, why are you like this?
I'm still your friend.

70
00:10:16,627 --> 00:10:17,840
Don't take it so hard.

71
00:10:18,273 --> 00:10:21,543
We`ll find that dandy freebee,
she won`t escape.

72
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,935
The man and cat are crying by the window

73
00:10:50,326 --> 00:10:54,700
Grey rain is dripping on the glass.

74
00:10:55,748 --> 00:11:00,663
To the man with a cat comes an ambulance,

75
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:05,950
The poor man has gone crazy

76
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:11,298
Doctor is coming, coming through the snowy plain,

77
00:11:12,486 --> 00:11:16,606
The doctor is carrying healing powder

78
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:22,926
The man and the cat will take that powder,

79
00:11:23,023 --> 00:11:30,231
Grief and melancholy will subside

80
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:55,008
The man and the cat are counting hardly the days

81
00:11:55,238 --> 00:12:00,000
The grey ceiling instead of blue sky

82
00:12:01,026 --> 00:12:05,571
The man and the cat fly at night

83
00:12:05,698 --> 00:12:11,359
But the dream doesn't come true

84
00:12:11,496 --> 00:12:16,313
Doctor is coming, coming through the snow plain

85
00:12:17,327 --> 00:12:22,200
The doctor is carrying healing powder.

86
00:12:23,027 --> 00:12:28,200
The man and the cat will take that powder 

87
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:34,300
Grief and melancholy will subside.

88
00:12:55,219 --> 00:12:59,900
Where are you, where are you, ambulance?

89
00:13:00,326 --> 00:13:05,500
The man is crying in the toilet.

90
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:10,600
But the walls are deaf, the pipes are like veins,

91
00:13:11,101 --> 00:13:15,800
And the toilet cistern beats fast like a heart.

92
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:21,300
Doctor is coming, coming through the snow plain,

93
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:26,800
The doctor is carrying healing powder.

94
00:13:27,764 --> 00:13:32,600
The man and the cat will take that powder, 

95
00:13:33,221 --> 00:13:38,800
Grief and melancholy will subside. 

96
00:14:43,033 --> 00:14:45,035
Where were you again last night?

97
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:47,453
	
On duty.

98
00:14:49,873 --> 00:14:51,233
	
Come here, sit.

99
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:57,196
Don't start it, mom...

100
00:14:57,411 --> 00:14:59,700
Can`t you understand,
that I`ll be fired from work...

101
00:15:00,632 --> 00:15:03,636
That I`ll be sweeping the yard...

102
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,353
How can I manage people..

103
00:15:11,631 --> 00:15:14,515
When I`ve raised a spy in my home.

104
00:15:19,797 --> 00:15:21,839
For 10 years since the death of your father I...

105
00:15:23,111 --> 00:15:26,110
showed you the correct path. Where are your lousy clothes?

106
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:30,362
Where is your American trash?
I`ll throw it out! I`ll burn it! 

107
00:15:30,688 --> 00:15:33,294
You'll go naked outside, you bitch!

108
00:15:34,381 --> 00:15:37,259
You have everything?
 What else do you need	?

109
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,514
Ungrateful swine you are..
What did I bring you up for?!

110
00:15:39,937 --> 00:15:42,681
To let you flash your panties from under the skirt?! 

111
00:15:43,128 --> 00:15:46,606
What are you looking at? What are you looking?
You, little bitch!

112
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:49,485
I've disciplined you a little, only a little, right?

113
00:15:50,852 --> 00:15:53,139
Now do I need to hit until there is a bloody nose!

114
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,132
Tanya, come with us to Broadway.
A hundred times you've been invited.

115
00:16:31,361 --> 00:16:32,554
No. no. I can't.

116
00:16:46,987 --> 00:16:49,787
Calm down, people! Calm down!

117
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,315
It's not a circus!

118
00:16:52,674 --> 00:16:56,809
Broadway

119
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:15,504
Ah oh...

120
00:18:16,247 --> 00:18:17,930
Look, he comes alone.

121
00:18:18,366 --> 00:18:19,500
Dude!

122
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,523
Are there scissors? 

123
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,300
It's time to return the favour.

124
00:18:23,468 --> 00:18:25,450
There is nothing to cut!

125
00:18:25,741 --> 00:18:28,500
A tuft of hair from a mangy mare!

126
00:18:28,924 --> 00:18:30,200
I`ve been invited.

127
00:18:30,463 --> 00:18:31,440
Who invited you?

128
00:18:32,107 --> 00:18:32,601
Polly.

129
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,495
She called and I came.

130
00:18:50,982 --> 00:18:51,850
Well, hello.

131
00:18:53,451 --> 00:18:54,026
Hi.

132
00:18:56,482 --> 00:18:57,782
Are you ill? 

133
00:18:59,032 --> 00:18:59,527
No.

134
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,553
It seemed that you stumbeled yesterday.

135
00:19:07,796 --> 00:19:08,749
You imagined it.

136
00:19:12,336 --> 00:19:12,964
Ah, well.

137
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:14,854
Bye.

138
00:19:17,286 --> 00:19:19,289
Be careful, you`ll get poisoned.

139
00:19:48,344 --> 00:19:50,058
Do you hear? Guard!

140
00:20:01,487 --> 00:20:02,589
Yeah!

141
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:04,023
Hi!

142
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:04,799
Hi!

143
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:06,074
Glad to see you.

144
00:20:07,192 --> 00:20:07,949
Hi, Chick.

145
00:20:12,276 --> 00:20:13,800
Hey, what is going on here? Huh?

146
00:20:15,139 --> 00:20:19,203
What are you harassing him for?
Such an inoffensive little slob.

147
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:23,070
Let's go to the club "KOK"!

148
00:20:31,746 --> 00:20:33,841
Dryn! Leave him alone! Let's go. 

149
00:20:40,995 --> 00:20:42,116
Hey, guys! I'm with you!

150
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:23,203
You from the heights, 

151
00:21:26,107 --> 00:21:29,000
of your beauty

152
00:21:31,285 --> 00:21:34,000
you don't notice me.

153
00:21:38,806 --> 00:21:41,000
But I can...

154
00:21:43,205 --> 00:21:44,800
help you...

155
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:51,000
know me better.

156
00:21:54,038 --> 00:21:58,000
Even if I'm nothing now, 

157
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:08,500
Even if they keep telling you, that I'm not the one.

158
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,013
But.

159
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,281
Give me this day,

160
00:22:12,657 --> 00:22:14,788
Give me this night,

161
00:22:14,946 --> 00:22:17,564
Give me just one chance

162
00:22:17,808 --> 00:22:19,885
And you'll realize,

163
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:25,000
that I'm what you need.

164
00:22:28,044 --> 00:22:29,900
Give me this day, 

165
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:32,000
Give me this night,

166
00:22:32,349 --> 00:22:35,000
Give me just one chance

167
00:22:35,276 --> 00:22:38,000
You won't sleep

168
00:22:39,548 --> 00:22:43,000
until I'm with you.

169
00:22:53,596 --> 00:22:54,996
What are you interested in? 

170
00:23:10,158 --> 00:23:12,058
You can get the rest at this address.

171
00:23:13,794 --> 00:23:15,825
Password is: "Does uncle Yosya work here?"

172
00:23:16,287 --> 00:23:18,017

175
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,671
Nolik - is me.
And You are from Nolik.

176
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,469
Hey,

177
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,988
Such regret,

178
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,128
That you've never met

179
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,904
such guys before.

180
00:23:41,898 --> 00:23:43,286
Excuse me, please.

181
00:23:44,228 --> 00:23:46,010
Does uncle Yosya work here?

182
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:50,270
Uncle Yosya has been on a pension for a while.

183
00:23:54,805 --> 00:23:59,920
But for you,

184
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,960
I'll change myself 

185
00:24:05,507 --> 00:24:09,684
And I'll start everything from the beginning.

186
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:16,400
Even if i'm nothing now,

187
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:27,547
Even if they keep telling you, that I'm not the one,

188
00:24:28,323 --> 00:24:29,569
But!

189
00:24:46,734 --> 00:24:48,637
Give me this day,

190
00:24:48,913 --> 00:24:51,140
Give me this night,

191
00:24:51,437 --> 00:24:53,435
Give me just one chance

192
00:24:53,622 --> 00:24:56,320
And you'll realize,

193
00:24:57,825 --> 00:25:00,985
I'm what you need.

194
00:25:04,423 --> 00:25:06,316
Give me this day,

195
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:08,978
Give me this night,

196
00:25:09,206 --> 00:25:11,227
Give me just one chance

197
00:25:11,474 --> 00:25:13,622
You won't sleep

198
00:25:15,842 --> 00:25:18,439
Until I'm with you.

199
00:25:46,934 --> 00:25:49,022
Let me go! You have no right to do it! 

200
00:25:49,194 --> 00:25:52,221
Quiet. Don't make a sound.

201
00:25:52,502 --> 00:25:54,187
Don`t be afraid.

202
00:25:54,411 --> 00:25:55,836
What's your name?

203
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:57,043
Bob.

204
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:57,801
How?

205
00:25:57,947 --> 00:25:58,748
Boris.

206
00:25:59,518 --> 00:26:00,918
Boris Mouseivich Toiter.

207
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,884
I'm Mels

208
00:26:05,237 --> 00:26:05,908
Listen, Bob....

209
00:26:07,022 --> 00:26:08,244
I have a favour to ask. 

210
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:10,755
Teach me style-dancing.

211
00:26:12,669 --> 00:26:13,874
Yeah? Get lost!

212
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:18,289
Don't you understand, you are the only 
guy I know among you.

213
00:26:18,565 --> 00:26:21,863
I found a friend, it was a pleasure to meet you. 
It doesn't mean anything.

214
00:26:22,103 --> 00:26:24,603
So, how is it, hard, hey?
Two stomps, three slaps.

215
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,638
Listen Bob...

216
00:26:28,846 --> 00:26:30,801
I won't leave you alone.

217
00:26:32,517 --> 00:26:38,378
Bob, you'll see me in your nightmares. 
Understand?

218
00:26:42,987 --> 00:26:45,001
What is in a dance?

219
00:26:45,225 --> 00:26:47,131
Dance is rhythmic body movement.

220
00:26:48,017 --> 00:26:49,941
For example, Vienna dance, or classical waltz.

221
00:26:50,732 --> 00:26:51,758
Dislocated back.

222
00:26:51,979 --> 00:26:52,745
Who?

223
00:26:52,951 --> 00:26:53,959
Not important.

224
00:26:54,649 --> 00:26:58,072
It's a three-beat movement with simultaneous 
rotation around the partner.

225
00:26:59,208 --> 00:27:01,182
Jazz instead of classical style is...

226
00:27:01,313 --> 00:27:02,076
Oh, Come on!

227
00:27:07,051 --> 00:27:11,138
There are three main styles: atomic, 
Canadian and double Hamburg style. 

228
00:27:11,174 --> 00:27:12,125
Can we skip the theory?

229
00:27:15,414 --> 00:27:17,361
Ok. You're the man, I'm the girl. 

230
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,950
Hands off! Paw the girls, not me!

231
00:27:27,158 --> 00:27:27,828
What should I do?

232
00:27:28,924 --> 00:27:29,629
Like this.

233
00:27:39,208 --> 00:27:41,800
<i>[music] First of all, what are you doing with your hands?</i> 

234
00:27:42,146 --> 00:27:44,700
<i>[music] Any chick will hit you if you're dancing that way

235
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:46,000
<i>[music] And, now, with the right foot.

236
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,400
<i>[music] Hold yourself more straight! 

237
00:27:47,698 --> 00:27:50,300
<i>[music] Move your legs and close your mouth!

238
00:27:50,506 --> 00:27:51,557
<i>[music] Feel free. Like that.

239
00:27:51,574 --> 00:27:51,973
A sportsman? 

240
00:27:52,414 --> 00:27:52,937
Yeah.

241
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,800
<i>[music] Now squat a little..and turn around! 

242
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:59,004
Here you don't need to be stronger-faster-higher. 

243
00:28:01,141 --> 00:28:02,824
You just need...drive.

244
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:06,599
Well...energy. From here.

245
00:28:07,109 --> 00:28:11,000
<i>[music] I like boogie-woogie, 
I'm dancing boogie-woogie every day. 

246
00:28:12,783 --> 00:28:15,250
[music] To become a real dandy,

247
00:28:15,437 --> 00:28:18,100
[music] You need to know how to dance right

248
00:28:18,337 --> 00:28:20,900
[music] You should know,
what the canadian style is, 

249
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,600
<i>[music] It's all serious here, 
it's not the Polka or the Quadrille. 

250
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:26,180
<i>[music] There is the atomic and 
triple Hamburg style too.

251
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:28,777
<i>[music] now give it a go by yourself...

252
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,500
<i>[music] You like to boogie-woogie.

253
00:28:32,188 --> 00:28:34,000
<i>[music] You like to boogie-woogie.

254
00:28:35,018 --> 00:28:36,500
<i>[music] You like to boogie-woogie.

255
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,300
<i>[music] You like to boogie-woogie.

256
00:28:40,817 --> 00:28:44,000
<i>[music] You like to boogie-woogie.
You are dancing boogie-woogie every day.

257
00:29:07,267 --> 00:29:07,819
Hello

258
00:29:21,512 --> 00:29:22,141
Son...

259
00:29:25,036 --> 00:29:27,344
What are you doing in this house in our absence? 

260
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:29,307
We`re just dancing.

261
00:29:31,405 --> 00:29:35,265
In a country where not even a loud sneeze is allowed, 
so as not to fall under the penal code ...

262
00:29:36,593 --> 00:29:37,678
He's just dancing

263
00:29:40,601 --> 00:29:45,027
Still, the article "the worship of the West" 
has not been repealed.

264
00:29:45,768 --> 00:29:47,668
Please, take a look at yourself in the mirror...

265
00:29:48,932 --> 00:29:51,193
Even your hair breaks this code.

266
00:29:56,373 --> 00:29:57,019
Well, OK...

267
00:29:58,976 --> 00:30:00,123
Who is this young man? 

268
00:30:00,682 --> 00:30:01,391
My Comrade?

269
00:30:05,515 --> 00:30:07,415
Why do you think we are so simple?

270
00:30:09,112 --> 00:30:10,000
Bory..

271
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:16,566
This young man has the appearance of 
secret police.

272
00:30:16,603 --> 00:30:18,619
But why do you suspect anybody and everybody? 

273
00:30:18,655 --> 00:30:20,680
And do you know what's this?
And why it's here?

274
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:26,301
These are the necessary things for a man in jail. 

275
00:30:27,482 --> 00:30:31,311
Uncle Adolf was sent to prison only 
because of his politically wrong name!

276
00:30:32,275 --> 00:30:33,775
And aunt Fira went there...

277
00:30:34,379 --> 00:30:38,120
Because she put Stalin's portrait
 in front of the toilet. 

278
00:30:39,106 --> 00:30:41,941
But they didn't even explain to me 
why I was in prison. 

279
00:30:43,572 --> 00:30:44,907
But these impressions in me ...

280
00:30:46,708 --> 00:30:48,181
I'll remember for the rest of my life. 

281
00:30:48,816 --> 00:30:50,728
But Dad! It`s impossible to live such way! 

282
00:30:51,444 --> 00:30:54,467
From this locked door,
 with that damned suitcase!

283
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,670
You`re a doctor, you should understand it! 

284
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:02,193
It's an endless mental supression, 
that will lead to the disintegration of personality!

285
00:31:02,221 --> 00:31:02,696
Bory

286
00:31:02,732 --> 00:31:04,050
What, mom?

287
00:31:04,087 --> 00:31:08,573
If you do not feel sorry for yourself, 
then at least have pity on us, with father.

288
00:31:30,977 --> 00:31:32,477
Son, aren't your pants too tight?

289
00:31:36,426 --> 00:31:38,441
And you have tried this stuff...

290
00:31:39,656 --> 00:31:40,685
Gel, before?

291
00:31:43,191 --> 00:31:45,552
All of a sudden rain... 
Or a street sweeper...

292
00:31:45,998 --> 00:31:47,251
And..it'll tumble down.

293
00:31:52,609 --> 00:31:53,166
Mels.

294
00:31:53,462 --> 00:31:53,963
What?

295
00:31:55,077 --> 00:31:55,895
Are you crazy?

296
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:57,827
About what?

297
00:31:58,154 --> 00:32:00,649
Crisis occurance in the U.S. economy.

298
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,552
Who are you? 
Are you going outside like this?

299
00:32:04,024 --> 00:32:07,909
Of course. Unloading wagons at 
night will not be in vein.

300
00:32:07,946 --> 00:32:09,157
Father, tell him!

301
00:32:09,956 --> 00:32:11,735
Well what? I like it!

302
00:32:11,962 --> 00:32:14,406
In the village, we also used 
to dress up to scare girls.

303
00:32:15,729 --> 00:32:18,172
Sometimes we made people around have a goosebumps.

304
00:32:23,652 --> 00:32:24,256
Hello

305
00:32:38,796 --> 00:32:39,571
Hello, Misha

306
00:32:43,224 --> 00:32:44,020
Hello

307
00:32:57,245 --> 00:32:57,880
Hello

308
00:33:12,544 --> 00:33:13,525
What's up, Vitek?

309
00:33:18,133 --> 00:33:19,933
I won't get laid by a dandy!

310
00:33:23,182 --> 00:33:26,653
Alright, Lena, don't ask me
 to repair your bike.

311
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:31,344
Dandy! Dandy!

312
00:33:31,568 --> 00:33:33,799
Dandy! Dandy!

313
00:33:34,082 --> 00:33:36,191
Dandy! Dandy!

314
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,300
Cocktail Hall (KOK club)

315
00:34:19,443 --> 00:34:21,193
Guys, what are we waiting for, tell me, uh? 

316
00:34:21,653 --> 00:34:22,270
Dudes..

317
00:34:23,492 --> 00:34:24,102
Huh?

318
00:34:29,952 --> 00:34:30,537
Look...

319
00:34:32,343 --> 00:34:33,933
Got looking like a human being. 

320
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:44,608
As a bourgeois writer Chehov used to say..

321
00:34:46,742 --> 00:34:48,960
It is necessary to squeeze a drop of a ...

322
00:34:50,486 --> 00:34:51,320
A slob

323
00:34:54,245 --> 00:34:54,821
Dude

324
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:57,621
Dude!

325
00:35:18,003 --> 00:35:18,830
"Made in Tambov?"

326
00:35:21,326 --> 00:35:23,481
I think, I have one left somewhere. I'll bring it.

327
00:35:25,026 --> 00:35:25,544
Fred

328
00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:27,637
Mels

329
00:35:31,887 --> 00:35:32,407
Betty

330
00:35:33,808 --> 00:35:34,331
Mels

331
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,297
Come alone?  We usually stay in pairs.

332
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:48,000
It's easier to beat off the slobs. 

333
00:35:50,008 --> 00:35:50,708
Dryn

334
00:35:52,545 --> 00:35:53,012
Mels

335
00:35:58,822 --> 00:35:59,354
Mels

336
00:36:01,882 --> 00:36:02,386
Mel

337
00:36:04,196 --> 00:36:05,041
Mel!

338
00:36:14,935 --> 00:36:15,857
Booked out.

339
00:36:18,117 --> 00:36:19,764
We paid already. We paid. 

340
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:24,090
Easy, people. They have a reservation. 

341
00:36:24,812 --> 00:36:26,096
They're with us. We paid.

342
00:36:38,508 --> 00:36:41,366
No room. No room.

343
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:47,148
She's with us, with us.

344
00:36:48,023 --> 00:36:49,233
Why are you late today?

345
00:37:35,273 --> 00:37:36,612
Let's go dancing Atomic Style.

346
00:37:38,399 --> 00:37:39,570
Are you always so pushy?

347
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,211
I`m not pushy 

348
00:37:43,649 --> 00:37:44,570
I`m purposeful 

349
00:37:46,087 --> 00:37:47,935
I'm not a prize for you to win.

350
00:37:50,427 --> 00:37:52,348
And what should I do?

351
00:38:00,533 --> 00:38:04,532
Hey, dandies, hello! We hang out on Broadway.

352
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:11,500
and we left the boring slobs behind

353
00:38:13,589 --> 00:38:18,500
I`ve told you about jazz and freedom 

354
00:38:20,307 --> 00:38:23,900
I've put a stylish tie on for you.

355
00:38:24,223 --> 00:38:28,000
Oh, my little babe,

356
00:38:29,128 --> 00:38:30,500
stay with me.

357
00:38:30,974 --> 00:38:34,500
Oh, my little babe,

358
00:38:35,766 --> 00:38:37,500
I'm your playboy.

359
00:38:37,723 --> 00:38:41,000
Oh, my little babe,

360
00:38:42,216 --> 00:38:44,000
don't you leave me.

361
00:38:44,431 --> 00:38:48,000
Oh, my little babe,

362
00:38:48,672 --> 00:38:52,500
My swallow!

363
00:39:05,739 --> 00:39:07,800
Hey, dandies, come with me!

364
00:39:08,228 --> 00:39:11,300
through forbidden doors!

365
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,000
If they catch us, I'll solve the problem.

366
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,094
If you don't have a place to check your feelings,

367
00:39:25,898 --> 00:39:29,000
I'll find the keys to room to leave them.

368
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,122
Oh, my little babe,

369
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,000
stay with me!

370
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,200
Oh, my little babe,

371
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,590
I'm your playboy. 

372
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,106
Oh, my little babe

373
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,500
don't you leave me.

374
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Oh, my little babe,

375
00:39:53,863 --> 00:39:57,000
My swallow.

376
00:40:22,867 --> 00:40:27,000
Oh, my little babe.

377
00:40:30,237 --> 00:40:33,400
Oh, my little babe.

378
00:40:34,831 --> 00:40:39,000
My swallow

379
00:40:48,336 --> 00:40:50,000
Calm down, guys, calm down.

380
00:40:50,261 --> 00:40:50,833
We're on Broadway.

381
00:40:51,704 --> 00:40:53,862
Mel, your guys.

382
00:40:59,518 --> 00:41:00,507
Hey, guys.

383
00:41:02,139 --> 00:41:03,500
Good evening, Katya.

384
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,880
What does it mean, Mels? 

385
00:41:10,382 --> 00:41:11,372
Nothing.

386
00:41:12,913 --> 00:41:14,213
Hello, Commissar, it's me!

387
00:41:16,814 --> 00:41:18,614
It's just a different suit.

388
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:21,252
You have one.

389
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,210
And I have a different one.

390
00:41:24,383 --> 00:41:26,083
You know, just different, Katya

391
00:41:34,073 --> 00:41:35,873
You are worse than the enemy, Mels.

392
00:41:36,897 --> 00:41:38,297
You are a traitor.

393
00:41:38,311 --> 00:41:40,191
Katya, do not start, eh? Katya ...

394
00:41:40,229 --> 00:41:40,685
Let's go

395
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,445
Katya...

396
00:41:43,266 --> 00:41:44,666
Stand at ease, comrade.

397
00:41:56,436 --> 00:41:59,555
Phew. I didn't even need to call my dad.

398
00:42:38,833 --> 00:42:42,494
Hey, man, do you know where 
can I bye a saxaphone?

399
00:42:42,944 --> 00:42:44,844
Maybe you need a machine gun too?

400
00:42:54,149 --> 00:42:55,707
Interested in getting a saxaphone?

401
00:42:57,264 --> 00:42:58,043
I am.

402
00:43:06,381 --> 00:43:07,740
If it doesn't work out, it's not my fault.

403
00:43:15,965 --> 00:43:17,834
There's a Dandy. He's asking for a saxaphone.

404
00:43:22,608 --> 00:43:23,127
Hello

405
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:24,172
Good Day.

406
00:43:25,785 --> 00:43:27,246
How old are you, young man?

407
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:28,831
Twenty.

408
00:43:30,345 --> 00:43:34,182
And you still don't know in 
what amasing country we live?

409
00:43:35,268 --> 00:43:37,852
Bayan is permissible, accordion is not permissible

410
00:43:38,771 --> 00:43:40,438
Clarinet is a correct instrument.

411
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:44,142
And sax is equated with a cold steel - a gun.

412
00:43:46,195 --> 00:43:47,696
Come back in 10 years

413
00:43:48,071 --> 00:43:51,450
When jazz will be played on morning 
perfomances in kindergardens..

414
00:43:53,034 --> 00:43:54,118
And then we'll speak.

415
00:43:54,618 --> 00:43:58,018
Listen, I understood you. 
But I need it now. 

416
00:44:01,125 --> 00:44:02,925
I have money with me.

417
00:44:37,411 --> 00:44:42,000
Mamba and Twist, Jimmy, Foxtrot and Tango 

418
00:44:44,085 --> 00:44:48,000
I played them many times in my life

419
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:55,000
I'm a captain, a very high rank.

420
00:44:57,346 --> 00:45:02,000
of a rotting boat, named, "Jazz".

421
00:45:04,354 --> 00:45:08,500
It's better if it were a submarine in this country.

422
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,557
Better to be a submarine!

423
00:45:11,615 --> 00:45:14,970
Jazz in this country has no place to stay. 

424
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,593
Jazz has no place to stay!

425
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:22,149
I filled up my holds with wine and vodka.

426
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:24,783
Vodka!

427
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,343
While on course never was I stopped

428
00:45:39,722 --> 00:45:44,000
This I know, but oh what a rush.

429
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,800
Melody, rhythm and drive

430
00:45:46,979 --> 00:45:50,800
When you and your sax are one.

431
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,266
Oh, yeah!

432
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:57,400
But if you need to know it all

433
00:45:57,573 --> 00:45:59,500
and play this kind of music

434
00:45:59,992 --> 00:46:05,000
play, showing no fear, and you won't drown.

435
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,500
New York

436
00:49:01,868 --> 00:49:02,716
Yeah, baby!

437
00:49:03,304 --> 00:49:07,306
Yes, aha, very nice!

438
00:50:01,731 --> 00:50:02,532
Kim.

439
00:50:07,318 --> 00:50:07,883
Kim!

440
00:50:09,583 --> 00:50:10,498
What happened?

441
00:50:14,774 --> 00:50:17,162
Everyone has brothers, 
but I have a dandy!

442
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Fred's apartment

443
00:50:36,419 --> 00:50:37,184
Good Day.

444
00:50:37,185 --> 00:50:37,768
Hello

445
00:50:38,907 --> 00:50:39,988
Oh, what a beautiful day.

446
00:50:39,989 --> 00:50:41,104
Wonderful

447
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:45,681
Feden'ka, the food is in the fridge. 

448
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:48,289
I've cooked your favorite cutlets...

449
00:50:48,636 --> 00:50:53,838
Salad also. Shirts for the institute are
in wardrobe, clean and ironed...

450
00:50:54,776 --> 00:50:58,982
You have an exam soon, 
so learn hard, especially english.

451
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:02,027
OK, mom.

452
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:05,255
Oh, my poor baby. 

453
00:51:12,341 --> 00:51:15,691
Fedor, when you practice your English ...

454
00:51:16,353 --> 00:51:19,646
Please, don't do it as loud as you did it last time, understand?

455
00:51:20,335 --> 00:51:20,861
Okay

456
00:51:27,856 --> 00:51:29,932
Thank you. Well, good luck!

457
00:52:10,208 --> 00:52:12,015
Oh girls, you see...

458
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:14,092
Oh, Mel

459
00:52:14,456 --> 00:52:17,470
Oh Mel!, How are you?

460
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:20,702
What?

461
00:52:23,314 --> 00:52:25,694
Ok, well I'll catch up with you.

462
00:52:34,799 --> 00:52:36,651
You know, Mel, look...

463
00:52:37,489 --> 00:52:41,162
Girls interested in us are 
divided into a few categories.

464
00:52:44,832 --> 00:52:46,120
There are "real chicks"

465
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:48,586
They are small in number.

466
00:52:49,962 --> 00:52:56,214
Some of them are "loose" (borukhi).  
Well, they..they you know with us.

467
00:52:57,612 --> 00:52:58,922
I hope, you understand, what i mean.

468
00:53:00,993 --> 00:53:02,693
Their number is less then small.

469
00:53:04,707 --> 00:53:05,707
Do you want?

470
00:53:10,022 --> 00:53:11,925
Then there are "pink-cheeked broads".

471
00:53:12,718 --> 00:53:13,318
Broads?

472
00:53:13,391 --> 00:53:13,956
Well, yeah.

473
00:53:14,448 --> 00:53:17,969
Their mother doesn't let them dress stylish, 
but they really want to. Understand?

474
00:53:17,995 --> 00:53:18,765
Understood.

475
00:53:26,634 --> 00:53:28,888
Ah! Also there are slobs

476
00:53:29,015 --> 00:53:29,778
I know'em.

477
00:53:29,779 --> 00:53:30,646
Very nice.

478
00:53:31,093 --> 00:53:36,622
And... then there are "rubtsi", "mochalki", "dinamiski" 

479
00:53:36,981 --> 00:53:37,981
And which is "Polza"?

480
00:53:39,288 --> 00:53:40,688
Well, Polza is Polza.

481
00:53:43,279 --> 00:53:44,879
That's all. Now teach yourself.

482
00:54:02,336 --> 00:54:04,755
Duke Ellington. Mandibular dislocation...

483
00:54:05,756 --> 00:54:08,763
It usually happens when the 
patient yawns too wide...

484
00:54:09,539 --> 00:54:12,285
Or takes a bite of an apple.

485
00:54:40,294 --> 00:54:40,936
Sorry.

486
00:55:24,226 --> 00:55:24,907
Come here.

487
00:55:26,274 --> 00:55:27,674
Well, come here.

488
00:55:31,945 --> 00:55:33,345
Beautiful, isn't it?

489
00:55:45,126 --> 00:55:46,426
I came...

490
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:50,250
I was looking for you...

491
00:55:51,881 --> 00:55:52,981
What for?

492
00:55:56,177 --> 00:55:58,152
There's something I need to say.

493
00:56:07,643 --> 00:56:08,718
I love you.

494
00:56:10,631 --> 00:56:11,631
It's serious

495
00:56:12,685 --> 00:56:13,288
Very...

496
00:56:14,951 --> 00:56:15,639
Ok

497
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:23,198
I want to kiss you.

498
00:56:27,199 --> 00:56:27,927
OK

499
00:56:37,453 --> 00:56:37,983
Stop.

500
00:56:38,515 --> 00:56:39,106
What?

501
00:56:39,825 --> 00:56:41,180
I need to go to Sir John

502
00:56:41,813 --> 00:56:42,342
Where?

503
00:56:42,995 --> 00:56:44,298
The toilet.

504
00:56:44,905 --> 00:56:45,685
Ah...

505
00:56:48,174 --> 00:56:48,920
Wait.

506
00:58:03,995 --> 00:58:07,564
Sleep easily at night mom, 
We support Dynamo! 

507
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:27,578
Don't be so sad

508
00:58:28,202 --> 00:58:30,451
Fred, does she have someone? 

509
00:58:33,129 --> 00:58:36,731
Take my advice. If it's only for fun,
then find someone easier.

510
00:58:38,197 --> 00:58:39,279
It's not just for that.

511
00:58:44,914 --> 00:58:45,828
Well, look...

512
00:58:47,231 --> 00:58:52,063
Every boy here... and a 100 more will say, 
that the've been with her...

513
00:58:54,938 --> 00:58:55,990
and all will be lying.

514
00:58:56,871 --> 00:59:01,052
Everyone tried, and everyone... falls short.

515
00:59:03,097 --> 00:59:03,754
And you?

516
00:59:05,871 --> 00:59:07,625
Oh, I'm have absolutely no chance.

517
00:59:08,758 --> 00:59:11,500
Because my dad is diplomat, because i study 
at MGIMO. (the institute of international relations) 

518
00:59:11,691 --> 00:59:13,227
Because I have a car and these apartments. 

519
00:59:13,263 --> 00:59:14,013
And she...

520
00:59:15,507 --> 00:59:16,166
Polza.

521
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:19,290
She always does things the other way round.

522
00:59:24,812 --> 00:59:25,385
Listen...

523
00:59:27,271 --> 00:59:29,689
Have you ever... been with a girl?

524
00:59:34,784 --> 00:59:37,923
Look, when you get a girl into bed...

525
00:59:38,389 --> 00:59:39,705
what's to happen next?

526
00:59:40,041 --> 00:59:41,564
What's so hard?

527
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:43,459
Blank!

528
00:59:45,478 --> 00:59:47,451
Why should I teach you everything?

529
00:59:53,859 --> 00:59:55,043
Take this, and read.

530
00:59:56,249 --> 00:59:57,598
It will make sense.

531
00:59:58,601 --> 01:00:03,125
But only at home, in a secure place.
Eat it in an emergency.

532
01:00:03,846 --> 01:00:05,790
Like a spy eats his secret addresses, understand? 

533
01:01:53,413 --> 01:01:55,151
(Knock at the door) 

534
01:01:56,053 --> 01:01:57,253
Are you alive in there?

535
01:01:57,386 --> 01:01:59,480
Others need in too. Get out! 

536
01:03:05,996 --> 01:03:06,653
Come on.

537
01:03:08,653 --> 01:03:09,901
Go, go, go!

538
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:25,300
I see...

539
01:04:26,358 --> 01:04:29,482
I see your eyes again

540
01:04:30,452 --> 01:04:32,608
This is a reflection...

541
01:04:33,734 --> 01:04:36,300
of my love.

542
01:04:37,399 --> 01:04:39,592
All the world...

543
01:04:40,805 --> 01:04:43,000
I easily turned...

544
01:04:44,403 --> 01:04:45,559
towards you

545
01:04:47,846 --> 01:04:50,000
Everywhere I see you.

546
01:04:53,181 --> 01:04:56,300
Let all be as you want,

547
01:04:56,331 --> 01:04:59,600
let your eyes shine as before,

548
01:04:59,653 --> 01:05:03,565
I'm with you again tonight

549
01:05:03,577 --> 01:05:05,681
and through

550
01:05:07,067 --> 01:05:08,666
the next night.

551
01:05:10,814 --> 01:05:12,300
If you want,

552
01:05:12,318 --> 01:05:15,000
I'll be yours again.

553
01:05:18,778 --> 01:05:20,915
And for me it's not important

554
01:05:21,846 --> 01:05:25,381
what day or what time

555
01:05:25,382 --> 01:05:28,900
for time has stopped

556
01:05:28,924 --> 01:05:32,600
I see only heaven in your eyes

557
01:05:32,564 --> 01:05:35,450
I am free and happy.

558
01:05:35,521 --> 01:05:39,000
For this song is about

559
01:05:39,546 --> 01:05:43,000
what we know - life is so beautiful.

560
01:05:43,416 --> 01:05:46,506
We believe, and understand later.

561
01:05:48,974 --> 01:05:51,800
Let all be as you want,

562
01:05:51,763 --> 01:05:54,856
let your eyes shine as before,

563
01:05:54,945 --> 01:05:58,758
I'm with you again tonight

564
01:05:58,932 --> 01:06:00,438
and through

565
01:06:02,451 --> 01:06:03,937
the next night,

566
01:06:06,188 --> 01:06:07,800
if you want,

567
01:06:08,087 --> 01:06:10,226
I'll be yours again.

568
01:06:24,624 --> 01:06:27,400
My friends and brothers!

569
01:06:27,751 --> 01:06:30,869
I'll share with you happiness.

570
01:06:31,878 --> 01:06:34,580
It'll be enough for everybody today

571
01:06:35,092 --> 01:06:38,129
I know this and I'm not afraid

572
01:06:39,299 --> 01:06:41,394
I hope, that on this stage everyone

573
01:06:41,911 --> 01:06:45,054
everyone someday

574
01:06:45,689 --> 01:06:49,201
Will sing such words like mine.

575
01:06:49,783 --> 01:06:51,933
Words about love.

576
01:06:54,671 --> 01:06:57,757
Let all be as you want,

577
01:06:57,829 --> 01:07:01,000
let your eyes shine as before,

578
01:07:01,144 --> 01:07:04,753
I'm with you again tonight

579
01:07:05,027 --> 01:07:06,500
and through

580
01:07:08,784 --> 01:07:10,100
the next night.

581
01:07:10,585 --> 01:07:11,660
and next night,

582
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:12,517
if you want.

583
01:07:16,757 --> 01:07:18,357
I'll be yours again.

584
01:09:01,639 --> 01:09:02,880
Train!

585
01:09:02,881 --> 01:09:03,492
Let's go!

586
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:07,228
Come on, run-run-run!

587
01:09:13,131 --> 01:09:15,151
O-o-o!

588
01:09:24,312 --> 01:09:28,863
Don't turn on the music, don't use the bathroom

589
01:10:38,111 --> 01:10:41,214
Mascara has run, and your clothes are wrinkled

590
01:10:41,505 --> 01:10:44,200
forget school, mom and shame.

591
01:10:44,795 --> 01:10:49,500
and there's a run in your stocking

592
01:10:50,531 --> 01:10:53,400
Every ban is making me laugh.

593
01:10:53,807 --> 01:10:56,600
Before harsh rules, I did nothing

594
01:10:56,957 --> 01:11:01,589
And only you can say - who I am.

595
01:11:03,195 --> 01:11:06,326
The badges on the grey jackets,

596
01:11:06,808 --> 01:11:09,500
show faces of boredom and fear.

597
01:11:09,638 --> 01:11:14,770
I was like everybody else, before I met you. 

598
01:11:16,048 --> 01:11:19,800
But life is gonna change now,

599
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:23,344
We'll go out of this door together...

600
01:11:23,487 --> 01:11:30,000
and we'll be together - regarless of the cost.

601
01:12:56,027 --> 01:13:02,179
Running minute hands and 
the neighbors behind the wall

602
01:13:03,232 --> 01:13:07,382
My world will never be the same.

603
01:13:18,001 --> 01:13:24,178
We need each other like air and water.

604
01:14:20,893 --> 01:14:21,771
Hello, Mels

605
01:14:22,482 --> 01:14:23,219
Hi, Kommisar

606
01:14:23,585 --> 01:14:25,575
I actually have a name, 
have you already forgotten?

607
01:14:27,071 --> 01:14:28,147
Hello, Katya

608
01:14:29,457 --> 01:14:30,647
And in your style, how is it?

609
01:14:31,192 --> 01:14:32,050
Katty?

610
01:14:32,877 --> 01:14:35,318
Listen, it's frightening to submit? 
You're waiting for someone?

611
01:14:35,355 --> 01:14:35,959
For you

612
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:39,402
Can I ask you something as an old friend?

613
01:14:39,906 --> 01:14:44,054
Just now our player broke and you understand 
better than all how to fix this.

614
01:14:44,892 --> 01:14:45,948
And in your style, how is it?

615
01:14:47,509 --> 01:14:48,396
Always ready!

616
01:14:52,699 --> 01:14:55,975
He's a dandy. We should put him 
into a cell to scare children. 

617
01:14:56,449 --> 01:14:59,010
Your not disgusted to be next to him? 
You're a girl!

618
01:14:59,565 --> 01:15:01,273
You better take off your komsomol sign!

619
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:09,558
Katya, it will be easier for you if we walk on different
 sides of the street and meet at your place.

620
01:15:10,162 --> 01:15:10,912
No, I don't need to.

621
01:15:11,427 --> 01:15:14,853
I just want to know, how do you feel 
when people look at you this way?

622
01:15:16,841 --> 01:15:17,894
I like it!

623
01:15:19,232 --> 01:15:19,974
It's funny! 

624
01:15:20,503 --> 01:15:21,504
You could fall down.

625
01:15:22,888 --> 01:15:25,170
It's great, Katya, when all people are different.

626
01:15:25,747 --> 01:15:30,087
I'm like this. She's like this.
And your totally different

627
01:15:30,512 --> 01:15:31,705
Now get down!

628
01:15:36,557 --> 01:15:39,231
Can you walk normally?

629
01:15:42,047 --> 01:15:43,547
I don't want to be different.

630
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:44,322
Why?

631
01:15:46,317 --> 01:15:48,037
Because I don't imagine being better than others. 

632
01:15:48,772 --> 01:15:52,238
You're not better, you're not worse, you're just different!
Do you understand?

633
01:16:05,653 --> 01:16:07,967
Katya, do you have a thin screwdiver?

634
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:09,780
I'm looking..

635
01:16:20,904 --> 01:16:21,542
This?

636
01:16:25,282 --> 01:16:26,563
You are so beautiful, Katya.

637
01:16:28,964 --> 01:16:29,812
It's my mom's.

638
01:16:31,124 --> 01:16:31,824
Do you like? 

639
01:16:32,541 --> 01:16:33,158
I like.

640
01:16:34,343 --> 01:16:36,019
You look like a person!

641
01:16:37,584 --> 01:16:38,460
Thank you.

642
01:16:38,497 --> 01:16:39,741
Well, Take it easy! 

643
01:16:42,728 --> 01:16:43,294
Look..

644
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:46,312
Look, you're so beautiful!

645
01:16:48,674 --> 01:16:49,437
Look.

646
01:16:54,030 --> 01:16:54,686
Do you see?

647
01:16:58,029 --> 01:17:00,056
So many things have happened since last time!!

648
01:17:00,643 --> 01:17:04,991
Can you imagine, Semen caught an armed 
criminal, face to face, at the train station.

649
01:17:05,469 --> 01:17:09,587
He had a knife, and Semen caught 
the edge by bare hand! 

650
01:17:10,258 --> 01:17:12,874
He is in a plaster now, there was 
something in newspaper about him.

651
01:17:13,459 --> 01:17:15,331
And I thought you try to catch only us.

652
01:17:15,368 --> 01:17:15,974
Oh, come on! 

653
01:17:17,559 --> 01:17:18,442
And Ivan married.

654
01:17:19,678 --> 01:17:25,462
You know her, Luba. The big one. 
She does shot-put in sports.

655
01:17:26,087 --> 01:17:26,690
Do you remember?

656
01:17:28,115 --> 01:17:29,085
Is it interesting for you?

657
01:17:29,618 --> 01:17:30,147
Sure.

658
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:31,842
Let's drink some more

659
01:17:35,628 --> 01:17:36,249
OK.

660
01:17:37,321 --> 01:17:37,834
To what?

661
01:17:39,328 --> 01:17:40,090
To you.

662
01:18:00,006 --> 01:18:01,439
Do you want me to put on some music? 

663
01:18:06,264 --> 01:18:09,516
You mean your... "Boogie Bones"?

664
01:18:10,799 --> 01:18:11,513
Yes.

665
01:18:14,083 --> 01:18:14,657
I want! 

666
01:19:30,331 --> 01:19:31,721
Katya, what are you doing?

667
01:19:33,513 --> 01:19:33,973
Katya.

668
01:19:35,484 --> 01:19:37,441
Katya, stop it! What if your parents come home? 

669
01:19:37,476 --> 01:19:39,108
They won't. I made them go to the theater.

670
01:19:39,261 --> 01:19:40,402
Katya, are you crazy? 

671
01:19:42,421 --> 01:19:44,674
This is all that you want from her. Why am I worse?

672
01:19:44,710 --> 01:19:45,927
So, did you decide to rescue me?

673
01:19:46,794 --> 01:19:47,872
I don't need it

674
01:19:49,832 --> 01:19:50,707
I'm fine

675
01:19:50,744 --> 01:19:52,817
But you told me that I'm beautiful.

676
01:19:52,854 --> 01:19:53,916
You are beautiful, Katya. 

677
01:19:54,584 --> 01:19:56,139
But I love her, do you understand? 

678
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:57,586
Who? 

679
01:20:00,337 --> 01:20:01,134
That bitch?

680
01:20:03,067 --> 01:20:04,179
That prostitute?

681
01:20:04,770 --> 01:20:05,763
You don't even know her.

682
01:20:07,057 --> 01:20:09,190
Still enough, to know her type!

683
01:20:10,858 --> 01:20:12,069
Ok, Katya, I`m leaving

684
01:20:14,636 --> 01:20:15,452
Sorry Katya.

685
01:20:16,410 --> 01:20:19,750
Get out! Get out!

686
01:20:19,787 --> 01:20:20,650
Sorry, Katya.

687
01:20:20,687 --> 01:20:22,627
Go away.

688
01:20:22,663 --> 01:20:23,657
I'm going.

689
01:20:23,851 --> 01:20:28,274
Go away, away!

690
01:20:29,197 --> 01:20:30,422
Go away.

691
01:20:56,713 --> 01:20:58,660
Stop taunting the animal!

692
01:21:02,665 --> 01:21:03,675
Come to my room

693
01:21:04,830 --> 01:21:06,553
I'm coming

694
01:21:08,061 --> 01:21:12,429
So, Fedor, I call you every time before 
we're coming back, right? 

695
01:21:15,289 --> 01:21:17,819
And do you have enough time to tidy up the house?

696
01:21:20,345 --> 01:21:20,942
Yes.

697
01:21:22,061 --> 01:21:24,244
So can you explain why in my office... 

698
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:30,643
Did I find this "armour"? Hmmm?

699
01:21:35,122 --> 01:21:37,464
Betty.. I'm sorry, dad!

700
01:21:38,777 --> 01:21:44,053
I understand it's possible to leave a hair-pin, 
or scarf, or..virginity eventually. I'm sorry.

701
01:21:47,677 --> 01:21:50,617
But how could she go without a bra, I can't understand. 

702
01:21:53,068 --> 01:21:56,404
One time, Fedor, your mother could find it. 

703
01:21:56,898 --> 01:22:01,328
And I'll have the problems. Me, not you!

704
01:22:02,572 --> 01:22:03,182
Understand? 

705
01:22:03,447 --> 01:22:03,938
OK

706
01:22:04,566 --> 01:22:06,639
I'll check everybody myself.

707
01:22:07,748 --> 01:22:10,604
Hold on. I need to talk to you.

708
01:22:18,222 --> 01:22:19,058
Did you take? 

709
01:22:19,667 --> 01:22:20,261
Are you crazy.

710
01:22:20,799 --> 01:22:21,439
I'll kill you.

711
01:22:26,909 --> 01:22:28,009
So let`s talk seriously

712
01:22:31,071 --> 01:22:32,204
Hide it!

713
01:22:36,752 --> 01:22:42,352
Fedor, I always speak as a minister, 
and I try to influence.

714
01:22:43,935 --> 01:22:46,752
You will go to USA for practice...

715
01:22:46,788 --> 01:22:47,931
Where? To America?

716
01:22:47,967 --> 01:22:48,585
Hold on. 

717
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:54,133
I want you to understand that it's not a pleasure trip.

718
01:22:55,458 --> 01:22:58,134
This is a first step in your career.

719
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:08,032
If everything goes well, you'll come back to finish the university. 
And you'll work here at the embassy.

720
01:23:09,585 --> 01:23:11,141
Do you agree?

721
01:23:11,421 --> 01:23:12,749
What a conversation, Dad?

722
01:23:12,786 --> 01:23:14,115
I asked you! Yes or no?

723
01:23:14,150 --> 01:23:14,757
Yes

724
01:23:16,005 --> 01:23:19,481
Are you ready to do everything for it?

725
01:23:19,813 --> 01:23:20,638
Of course.

726
01:23:21,628 --> 01:23:22,313
OK

727
01:23:26,044 --> 01:23:27,444
So I have three conditions.

728
01:23:29,230 --> 01:23:33,448
Tomorrow you'll change this clown's dress 
for normal Soviet clothes.

729
01:23:35,682 --> 01:23:38,934
Then you'll go to the barber 
and change you hair style...

730
01:23:39,549 --> 01:23:41,860
to the ideologically right style cut

731
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:53,340
And second,

732
01:23:56,153 --> 01:24:00,936
tomorrow you'll see your 
friends for the last time. 

733
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:14,845
Sorry for the cynicism, but these are the rules.

734
01:24:15,610 --> 01:24:21,292
And you should conform to these rules 
or you can work in the factory.

735
01:24:23,691 --> 01:24:26,758
I used to dance in halls too at your age

736
01:24:31,267 --> 01:24:36,511
And, believe me, that your silly hanging out on Broadway... 

737
01:24:36,947 --> 01:24:40,082
is just a bad made parody on what we had.

738
01:24:51,047 --> 01:24:54,351
Infantile diseases have to be had in childhood.

739
01:25:04,394 --> 01:25:05,000
And third? 

740
01:25:06,412 --> 01:25:07,833
Attention, recording is on.

741
01:25:09,273 --> 01:25:10,828
Nothing serious. You must marry.

742
01:25:11,224 --> 01:25:13,297
Parting with chicks. Take 1.

743
01:25:14,076 --> 01:25:14,744
Who?

744
01:25:16,377 --> 01:25:17,916
Girls, your part. 

745
01:25:18,619 --> 01:25:19,655
Only with Betty!

746
01:25:19,692 --> 01:25:21,971
What Betty, are you crazy? Betty...

747
01:25:22,839 --> 01:25:25,147
Fire in the eyes, pull in your stomachs and bottoms...

748
01:25:25,485 --> 01:25:30,837
Marry the daughter of academician Kupriyanov.

749
01:25:31,451 --> 01:25:35,302
She's had her eye on you since childhood.

750
01:25:36,239 --> 01:25:39,448
Give me more emotions and feelings.

751
01:25:40,912 --> 01:25:43,541
Though, we live good with your mother..

752
01:25:59,336 --> 01:26:02,444
He doesn't need an American wife!

753
01:26:03,092 --> 01:26:07,222
He doesn't need an American wife!

754
01:26:07,762 --> 01:26:11,892
He doesn't need an American wife!

755
01:26:12,267 --> 01:26:16,377
My sweetheart! Leaving here - say goodbye.

756
01:26:16,854 --> 01:26:20,200
I used to love you selflessly.

757
01:26:21,192 --> 01:26:25,307
You showed me the new world, the new Paradise,

758
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:29,930
And you're leaving now without notice.

759
01:26:30,576 --> 01:26:34,690
You're going to be a Soviet, common diplomat.

760
01:26:34,956 --> 01:26:39,069
As if you've forgotten your past,

761
01:26:39,710 --> 01:26:43,825
But we're still waiting for you, brother, 

762
01:26:44,172 --> 01:26:48,279
At heart you're dandy, the same as before.

763
01:26:49,345 --> 01:26:52,446
He doesn't need an American wife!

764
01:26:53,807 --> 01:26:56,916
He doesn't need an American wife!

765
01:26:58,729 --> 01:27:02,828
He doesn't need an American wife!

766
01:27:03,066 --> 01:27:06,400
Even if your luxury shoes are already dumped, 

767
01:27:06,402 --> 01:27:11,528
Even if the "Quiff" doesn't sparkle anymore with brilliantine

768
01:27:12,407 --> 01:27:15,536
I'm not going to shed a single tear.

769
01:27:16,829 --> 01:27:17,937
Goodbye, my dear,

770
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,534
My darling! My love machine!

771
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:24,869
Your choice is so clear. Go ahead, dude!

772
01:27:25,379 --> 01:27:29,490
Follow your father to the highway,

773
01:27:29,968 --> 01:27:33,568
It's a pity that you're leaving like this,

774
01:27:34,180 --> 01:27:38,307
Sorry, we are different, different just a little

775
01:27:38,892 --> 01:27:42,700
He doesn't need an American wife!

776
01:27:43,273 --> 01:27:47,100
He doesn't need an American wife!

777
01:27:47,943 --> 01:27:51,567
He doesn't need an American wife!

778
01:27:51,781 --> 01:27:53,000
No need!

779
01:27:53,532 --> 01:27:56,618
You'll be able to get a lot in return

780
01:28:01,624 --> 01:28:05,731
But you'll never feel free again.

781
01:28:06,002 --> 01:28:10,118
And your stylish youth will scarcely come back.

782
01:28:10,799 --> 01:28:14,923
He doesn't need an American wife! 

783
01:28:15,387 --> 01:28:19,200
He doesn't need an American wife! 

784
01:28:19,641 --> 01:28:23,775
He doesn't need an American wife! 

785
01:28:24,313 --> 01:28:28,439
He doesn't need an American wife! 

786
01:28:28,941 --> 01:28:32,564
He doesn't need an American wife! 

787
01:28:33,321 --> 01:28:37,449
He doesn't need an American wife! 

788
01:28:37,908 --> 01:28:42,034
He doesn't need an American wife! 

789
01:28:42,330 --> 01:28:46,461
He doesn't need an American wife! 

790
01:29:11,338 --> 01:29:12,102
Let's start. Comrade.

791
01:29:24,412 --> 01:29:26,356
Sit down, comrades, we are going to start.

792
01:29:29,751 --> 01:29:34,234
Today on the agenda, dealing with 
Komsomolets [Mels] Biryukov.

793
01:29:36,674 --> 01:29:38,592
Mels - rise!

794
01:29:47,685 --> 01:29:49,684
There was a Soviet student, Mels.

795
01:29:50,188 --> 01:29:51,488
And now we see...

796
01:29:51,856 --> 01:29:53,191
Dandy - Mel.

797
01:29:55,526 --> 01:29:59,530
It would seem, only one letter,
true comrades?, is so small.

798
01:30:01,115 --> 01:30:02,533
But let us remember, 

799
01:30:02,992 --> 01:30:05,202
what is in the name Mels.

800
01:30:06,704 --> 01:30:09,548
This is an abbreviation of our sacred names.

801
01:30:10,791 --> 01:30:11,781
Marx...

802
01:30:13,127 --> 01:30:14,117
Engels...

803
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:16,668
Lenin...

804
01:30:18,590 --> 01:30:19,890
Stalin.

805
01:30:23,637 --> 01:30:25,237
And now, let's think ... 

806
01:30:25,889 --> 01:30:30,142
What does it mean to carelessly 
discard the letter "S"?

807
01:30:50,413 --> 01:30:53,501
He used to live among us, we were stepping side by side. 

808
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:57,186
He was an honest guy, a simple hero,

809
01:30:57,200 --> 01:31:00,454
But truth can't be hidden, his hour has come

810
01:31:00,757 --> 01:31:03,680
He reveals his savage teeth

811
01:31:04,177 --> 01:31:07,273
He reveals his savage teeth.

812
01:31:07,431 --> 01:31:11,000
Bound with one chain,

813
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:14,340
Connected by one aim.

814
01:31:14,437 --> 01:31:17,800
Bound with one chain,

815
01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:20,056
Connected by one aim.

816
01:31:21,110 --> 01:31:24,195
You dared to encroach upon the holy of holies, 

817
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:26,700
Where are your ideals?

818
01:31:26,755 --> 01:31:27,955
You spit on them!

819
01:31:28,032 --> 01:31:31,800
You sold yourself to our enemy for bright rags

820
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:35,152
You easily desert your conscience and honour.

821
01:31:35,291 --> 01:31:38,900
But you will not win, our chain will never break

822
01:31:39,377 --> 01:31:42,130
Bound with one chain, 

823
01:31:42,130 --> 01:31:45,400
Connected by one aim.

824
01:31:45,550 --> 01:31:48,706
Bound with one chain, 

825
01:31:48,970 --> 01:31:52,400
Connected by one aim.

826
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:23,072
You dare not dance to the music of West,

827
01:32:23,337 --> 01:32:26,500
Don't dare be a fool, don't betray us

828
01:32:26,675 --> 01:32:30,100
Such a person like you should not be near us,

829
01:32:30,428 --> 01:32:33,400
When we march - we march as one

830
01:32:33,682 --> 01:32:36,864
Our Party is our mother, our Komsomol is our father!

831
01:32:36,934 --> 01:32:40,337
Hey you there.  Stand Still!
Good boy.

832
01:32:40,353 --> 01:32:43,455
We don't  sing to someone else's tune. 

833
01:32:44,348 --> 01:32:47,750
Our joyful bugle plays - awake up!

834
01:32:47,900 --> 01:32:51,373
Bound with one chain,

835
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:53,600
Connected with one aim

836
01:32:53,701 --> 01:32:57,800
Bound with one chain,

837
01:32:57,872 --> 01:33:00,000
Connected with one aim.

838
01:33:01,207 --> 01:33:04,281
Here is no place for scoundrels and scams, 

839
01:33:04,300 --> 01:33:08,189
Here is no place for scoundrels and scams, 

840
01:33:08,214 --> 01:33:11,307
Here the choir sings, swimming with the flow.

841
01:33:11,467 --> 01:33:14,569
Here we march as one, it's unity we love

842
01:33:14,805 --> 01:33:18,100
We are happy just to go without you,

843
01:33:18,224 --> 01:33:19,224
And to be! 

844
01:33:19,330 --> 01:33:22,036
Bound with one chain,

845
01:33:22,150 --> 01:33:25,350
Connected by one aim.

846
01:33:25,482 --> 01:33:29,000
Bound with one chain,

847
01:33:29,068 --> 01:33:32,214
Connected by one aim.

848
01:33:33,730 --> 01:33:35,730
Bound with one chain,

849
01:33:35,824 --> 01:33:39,300
Connected by one aim.

850
01:33:39,328 --> 01:33:42,600
Bound with one chain,

851
01:33:42,748 --> 01:33:46,300
Connected by one aim.

852
01:33:46,352 --> 01:33:49,507
Bound with one chain,

853
01:33:49,672 --> 01:33:53,200
Connected by one aim.

854
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:56,300
Bound with one chain,

855
01:33:56,594 --> 01:34:00,100
Connected by one aim.

856
01:35:22,210 --> 01:35:22,989
Are you going somewhere? 

857
01:35:24,123 --> 01:35:25,080
I have a bad news, Mel.

858
01:35:26,226 --> 01:35:27,124
Me too.

859
01:35:28,189 --> 01:35:29,298
I have really bad news..

860
01:35:29,335 --> 01:35:32,016
And I have really bad news too, what's yours?

861
01:35:33,167 --> 01:35:34,317
I'm leaving, we're through.

862
01:35:35,370 --> 01:35:35,946
And what's your news?

863
01:35:38,942 --> 01:35:40,028
Then I have...

864
01:35:41,692 --> 01:35:43,336
...just minor worries.

865
01:35:46,439 --> 01:35:47,675
Polina, what's wrong?

866
01:35:54,927 --> 01:35:56,298
Why do you keep silent?

867
01:35:57,149 --> 01:35:59,008
You can't decide this by yourself! 

868
01:35:59,654 --> 01:36:01,161
You can't decide this for both of us! 

869
01:36:02,271 --> 01:36:04,673
You can't decide this alone! 

870
01:36:04,710 --> 01:36:06,415
I`m pregnant, Mel! 

871
01:36:18,216 --> 01:36:19,486
That's great, Polly.

872
01:36:22,686 --> 01:36:24,223
So we'll have a baby. 

873
01:36:27,654 --> 01:36:28,985
It's not your baby, Mel.

874
01:36:40,326 --> 01:36:41,114
This is my baby.

875
01:36:46,990 --> 01:36:47,899
Mine.

876
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:52,101
This is my baby! 

877
01:37:01,824 --> 01:37:03,413
Also my mother turned me out of home.

878
01:37:50,848 --> 01:37:51,366
So

879
01:37:52,666 --> 01:37:53,548
That's a good thing.

880
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:00,055
Maybe now you will calm down. 

881
01:38:02,353 --> 01:38:03,753
What's the expression in science...

882
01:38:04,622 --> 01:38:09,694
Two minuses equal a positive!

883
01:38:13,564 --> 01:38:15,504
What are you standing thunderstrucked?

884
01:38:16,382 --> 01:38:17,053
Did you hear?

885
01:38:18,127 --> 01:38:20,064
Soon you will have a nephew.

886
01:38:21,431 --> 01:38:22,518
Move the beds now. 

887
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:35,235
I feel strange...

888
01:38:38,409 --> 01:38:40,384
that we shouldn't hide.

889
01:38:43,093 --> 01:38:43,775
Yeah.

890
01:38:52,795 --> 01:38:53,791
Polly...

891
01:38:54,580 --> 01:38:55,238
What?

892
01:38:57,308 --> 01:38:59,338
What do you think?

893
01:39:02,811 --> 01:39:05,213
It will not hurt him?

894
01:39:06,451 --> 01:39:08,435
Well, If we...

895
01:39:13,093 --> 01:39:14,159
I don't know.

896
01:39:21,891 --> 01:39:23,104
He is so little.

897
01:41:04,318 --> 01:41:04,867
Come on.

898
01:41:06,864 --> 01:41:08,578
Come on, come on!

899
01:41:12,907 --> 01:41:13,958
Come on, run, dear. 

900
01:41:49,273 --> 01:41:50,273
Soviet Ideology

901
01:42:08,300 --> 01:42:09,700
Play jazz today, sellout your country tomorrow!

902
01:42:17,903 --> 01:42:19,303
Under a strange tune!

903
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:42,060
Jazz - not our music.

904
01:43:37,217 --> 01:43:39,038
And it is a constant.

905
01:43:39,916 --> 01:43:44,860
Constant is invariable. Because usually...

906
01:44:14,162 --> 01:44:15,254
Just felt giddy.

907
01:44:15,613 --> 01:44:16,883
Let's go for fresh air.

908
01:44:17,544 --> 01:44:18,859
No. It's ok.

909
01:44:25,399 --> 01:44:27,169
I won't be able to dance at all soon. 

910
01:44:29,326 --> 01:44:31,282
Let's go to wedding registry office tomorrow? 

911
01:44:33,611 --> 01:44:34,329
Let's wait?

912
01:44:35,159 --> 01:44:36,256
Why wait?

913
01:44:45,865 --> 01:44:46,909
Wait for the birth.

914
01:44:52,706 --> 01:44:53,633
Stand still!

915
01:44:53,670 --> 01:44:54,604
RAID!!!

916
01:45:36,622 --> 01:45:37,324
Mel!

917
01:45:44,611 --> 01:45:45,264
Katya...

918
01:45:51,533 --> 01:45:53,786
So, what's this? Are you serious?

919
01:45:54,733 --> 01:45:56,765
Katya, that's enough, let her go.

920
01:45:58,945 --> 01:46:02,834
Katya, I'm begging you. Katya! 

921
01:46:10,554 --> 01:46:13,242
Take your hand off her, you beasts! 

922
01:46:14,326 --> 01:46:16,586
Oh, maybe you'll do a perm for me too?

923
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:19,088
I was going to cut my hair right today.

924
01:46:19,727 --> 01:46:23,807
Wow, without a line, maybe you'll live your number, 
so I can send my friends.

925
01:46:25,134 --> 01:46:29,540
By the way, what's the cost? 
I'm affraid I may not all of it with me.

926
01:46:30,870 --> 01:46:33,877
Miss, can you make it a liitle bit shorter?

927
01:46:34,615 --> 01:46:37,325
Just a little bit, please? 

928
01:46:38,954 --> 01:46:40,777
I'll come to you again with my hair cut.

929
01:46:44,285 --> 01:46:46,900
Miss, where are you going, miss? 

930
01:46:47,615 --> 01:46:48,826
Miss, and the tea?

931
01:47:15,558 --> 01:47:19,558
John is born.

932
01:48:10,290 --> 01:48:13,438
Everyone pour! Come-on! Pour!

933
01:48:16,613 --> 01:48:19,049
Polina, Polina

934
01:48:25,705 --> 01:48:27,416
Show us the boy!

935
01:48:27,606 --> 01:48:30,507
Why are you standing daddy? 
Frozen? Go meet them!

936
01:48:33,074 --> 01:48:36,596
Polin, show us the boy. 
Come on Polina

937
01:48:50,557 --> 01:48:52,387
Move your hands away! 
Give the Grandfarther...

938
01:48:53,832 --> 01:48:56,432
Who does he take after?

939
01:49:25,782 --> 01:49:27,205
Oh, mama!

940
01:49:28,507 --> 01:49:29,180
Ours.

941
01:49:37,290 --> 01:49:38,130
Ours!

942
01:49:39,243 --> 01:49:39,928
Ours.

943
01:49:42,692 --> 01:49:43,664
Hero!

944
01:49:46,977 --> 01:49:50,381
Our hero! 

945
01:50:40,062 --> 01:50:41,554
His name was Michael.

946
01:50:43,843 --> 01:50:44,833
One of us?

947
01:50:46,702 --> 01:50:49,106
No, he was American. 

948
01:50:56,794 --> 01:51:01,799
He was walking near our home, trying to stop 
at least someone to find out where he was...

949
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:03,900
But people run away from him.

950
01:51:04,149 --> 01:51:05,649
Did you love him? 

951
01:51:07,058 --> 01:51:09,544
No, It was completely different. 

952
01:51:13,257 --> 01:51:15,304
He was like a man from another planet...

953
01:51:15,826 --> 01:51:18,116
And he came only for couple of hours....

954
01:51:19,650 --> 01:51:22,050
And you need to find out as much about them 

955
01:51:22,100 --> 01:51:23,764
Tells so much about us...

956
01:51:25,058 --> 01:51:29,374
A minute ticking, ticking ... 
And the flight back is close.

957
01:51:30,621 --> 01:51:33,271
And we both knew that we'll 
never see each other again.

958
01:51:36,770 --> 01:51:38,570
Is this what you wanted to hear? 

959
01:51:40,987 --> 01:51:41,887
Satisfied?

960
01:52:23,255 --> 01:52:26,584
The way to ease international 
tension...

961
01:52:29,097 --> 01:52:30,010
Hello

962
01:52:48,949 --> 01:52:50,449
Well hello, daughter.

963
01:52:55,642 --> 01:52:56,875
Where are you going, you louse!

964
01:52:58,689 --> 01:53:03,099
Did you reach your goal?!
Achieved your American broad?!

965
01:53:03,659 --> 01:53:05,727
I was fired from work and 
from the komsomol.

966
01:53:09,329 --> 01:53:12,164
Citizen, citizeness, this is not right!

967
01:53:13,348 --> 01:53:13,974
Comrade.

968
01:53:17,096 --> 01:53:20,518
Comrade. Comrade?

969
01:53:22,350 --> 01:53:23,758
How am I your comrade?

970
01:53:24,498 --> 01:53:27,847
I'll put you all in prison!
I'll leave you all to rot there! 

971
01:53:28,346 --> 01:53:35,531
Animals! Animals! Animals! 
Pigs! Spies!

972
01:54:00,519 --> 01:54:02,264
What has the baby been named?

973
01:54:03,489 --> 01:54:04,307
Ivan

974
01:54:08,594 --> 01:54:09,665
Like her father, Ivan! 

975
01:54:11,744 --> 01:54:12,981
Well, let me look at him.

976
01:54:50,283 --> 01:54:51,883
He has our eyes however.

977
01:54:55,442 --> 01:54:58,818
What's this? What are you 
feeding him with, hey? 

978
01:54:59,758 --> 01:55:04,596
What do you mean, you think, this is 
a home, living in a common room!

979
01:55:05,424 --> 01:55:08,750
We have this room and the 
second one...with

980
01:55:09,224 --> 01:55:11,071
I know what you have.

981
01:55:13,152 --> 01:55:15,052
One bathroom for thirty men, right?

982
01:55:15,727 --> 01:55:19,227
Insanitary conditions - typhoid, 
tuberculosis, diarrhea, jaundice.

983
01:55:21,614 --> 01:55:23,014
Let's take you home.

984
01:55:26,685 --> 01:55:28,085
Pack your things.

985
01:55:33,603 --> 01:55:35,103
Nobody needs me now?

986
01:55:39,057 --> 01:55:40,457
Mom, I need you.

987
01:56:04,578 --> 01:56:05,288
Guys.

988
01:56:06,994 --> 01:56:07,847
Ivan.

989
01:56:09,492 --> 01:56:10,602
No, this is John

990
01:56:12,664 --> 01:56:13,743
Where is Polina?

991
01:56:14,185 --> 01:56:15,741
Do you hide her?

992
01:56:16,551 --> 01:56:19,455
It's all the same, you take about love and it ends in diapers.

993
01:56:19,492 --> 01:56:23,085
Betty, once you have your own child, you'll see.

994
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:25,485
God, no.

995
01:56:25,993 --> 01:56:27,029
Guys.

996
01:56:34,852 --> 01:56:35,840
Take your hand away! 

997
01:56:36,479 --> 01:56:38,686
Hi, Jonny, how are you?

998
01:56:41,925 --> 01:56:43,508
Good somewhat.

999
01:56:45,768 --> 01:56:49,511
Cute guy! I don't know how to hold him.

1000
01:56:57,566 --> 01:56:58,841
I love you, baby.

1001
01:57:05,695 --> 01:57:07,045
Mom has arrived.

1002
01:57:37,372 --> 01:57:40,894
You know what? Wait around the corner, 
I will be there soon.

1003
01:59:04,897 --> 01:59:07,497
So... You like music?

1004
01:59:18,298 --> 01:59:20,014
What kind of music do you like?

1005
01:59:21,810 --> 01:59:23,193
You don't understand...

1006
01:59:24,169 --> 01:59:26,856
OK. Let me show you something.

1007
01:59:27,172 --> 01:59:27,805
Look.

1008
01:59:28,784 --> 01:59:36,173
Look here.  Look, at what I got.
This is Charlie Parker.

1009
01:59:36,979 --> 01:59:38,395
Have you heard about Charlie Parker?

1010
01:59:38,431 --> 01:59:40,569
The best jazzmen, you know.

1011
01:59:40,953 --> 01:59:43,268
Come on. This is Miles Davis.

1012
01:59:43,306 --> 01:59:44,834
Have you heard this?

1013
01:59:46,119 --> 01:59:51,886
Oh, This is cat is great.
This is another Charlie parker.

1014
01:59:51,923 --> 01:59:53,780
Do you like Charlie Parker?

1015
01:59:54,423 --> 01:59:55,277
I like.

1016
01:59:56,216 --> 02:00:00,860
Oh, quite amazing.
But look at this, you know...

1017
02:00:10,854 --> 02:00:14,103
Hey, what's going on?
Let me go! I'm an American citizen.

1018
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:16,513
Fred...

1019
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:18,727
Mel...

1020
02:01:20,417 --> 02:01:21,054
Fred...

1021
02:01:21,700 --> 02:01:22,671
Mel...

1022
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:26,005
Fred!

1023
02:01:26,200 --> 02:01:27,379
Mel!

1024
02:01:27,390 --> 02:01:28,590
Quiet, quiet, I've asked you! 

1025
02:01:31,904 --> 02:01:32,894
Freddie

1026
02:01:34,992 --> 02:01:36,617
Polza, Polza

1027
02:02:02,729 --> 02:02:03,578
Polza

1028
02:02:05,939 --> 02:02:07,639
Understand. It's for you and baby.

1029
02:02:09,137 --> 02:02:12,537
The latest achievement of imperialism, 
by the way - no-spill cup.

1030
02:02:12,625 --> 02:02:14,225
You can turn it any way, it doesn't spill.

1031
02:02:14,651 --> 02:02:17,199
Don't talk to him. He don't even 
know how to put nipple on a bottle.

1032
02:02:17,495 --> 02:02:18,344
He's beyond this.

1033
02:02:19,310 --> 02:02:26,779
You see, Fred. Polina thinks, that in conditions 
of equality I must breastfeed the baby too.

1034
02:02:30,372 --> 02:02:33,810
Please, talk about this when I am not here. 

1035
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:38,997
I flied to you across the ocean. And I'm 
full of all this with my own family. 

1036
02:02:41,863 --> 02:02:46,563
Let me see the baby. 
We woke him up already. Come on

1037
02:02:51,661 --> 02:02:52,961
How are things with the mother in law?

1038
02:02:53,282 --> 02:02:54,272
Get along?

1039
02:02:56,045 --> 02:02:57,487
Good in the morning

1040
02:02:57,831 --> 02:02:59,205
Screaming at night

1041
02:03:00,548 --> 02:03:02,196
Baby misses our communal flat. 

1042
02:03:02,666 --> 02:03:04,418
He loves the queue into toilet. 

1043
02:03:10,621 --> 02:03:11,821
Is this him?

1044
02:03:19,331 --> 02:03:22,334
Mel, I think you've listened too 
much to Charlie Parker

1045
02:03:50,525 --> 02:03:50,665
Among the slums and skyscrapers there is a lot of ads,
Americans are walking and chewing gums.

1046
02:03:59,500 --> 02:03:59,616
Robbing, killing, humming,
And laying stylish ladies. 

1047
02:04:05,776 --> 02:04:06,650
Man

1048
02:05:04,252 --> 02:05:06,276
Queit, I've already asked, be quiet!

1049
02:05:22,462 --> 02:05:23,998
Do you know about Bob? 

1050
02:05:26,563 --> 02:05:28,131
Your dad can't help?

1051
02:05:29,097 --> 02:05:29,735
No.

1052
02:05:31,749 --> 02:05:33,041
They took Betty way from Moscow

1053
02:05:34,442 --> 02:05:35,229
I know.

1054
02:05:36,136 --> 02:05:38,038
And Dryn was sent to the army

1055
02:05:38,075 --> 02:05:38,733
Yeah.

1056
02:05:39,140 --> 02:05:42,561
He is crazy, He went to military 
registration in his cool clothes.

1057
02:05:42,945 --> 02:05:47,093
In his shoes, with that hair. So they've put 
him in a submarine for 5 years

1058
02:05:48,343 --> 02:05:50,648
Tell me about America.

1059
02:05:52,190 --> 02:05:53,008
About America...

1060
02:05:55,110 --> 02:05:56,047
About America...

1061
02:06:01,388 --> 02:06:02,430
This is an american style. 

1062
02:06:03,357 --> 02:06:06,175
What style? You look like a slob. 

1063
02:06:06,471 --> 02:06:08,471
What are you talking about?  Quality!

1064
02:06:09,501 --> 02:06:13,199
Touch it! And label?

1065
02:06:14,538 --> 02:06:17,000
It's more important what's inside. 

1066
02:06:18,764 --> 02:06:20,644
If person is free, he'll dress easy .

1067
02:06:23,475 --> 02:06:24,148
Mel

1068
02:06:26,576 --> 02:06:27,856
I have some bad news for you

1069
02:06:30,224 --> 02:06:31,078
There are no dandies.

1070
02:06:33,437 --> 02:06:34,583
How can it be?

1071
02:06:36,747 --> 02:06:39,347
Just like that - none.

1072
02:06:43,163 --> 02:06:45,915
If we walk on the real Brodway like this...

1073
02:06:46,521 --> 02:06:51,892
we'll be taken by psychiatrist after few blocks. 

1074
02:06:52,969 --> 02:06:56,478
Mel, there are no dandies there. 

1075
02:06:59,657 --> 02:07:00,472
Get out of here.

1076
02:07:00,509 --> 02:07:00,946
Mel

1077
02:07:02,598 --> 02:07:03,192
Get out.

1078
02:07:03,228 --> 02:07:03,830
Mel

1079
02:07:03,867 --> 02:07:05,044
Get lost.

1080
02:07:13,427 --> 02:07:15,159
But we are here.

1081
02:07:40,907 --> 02:07:44,800
Do not chase us, Mister, from the entrance.

1082
02:07:48,247 --> 02:07:52,895
We're not gonna sing so loud anymore.

1083
02:07:54,921 --> 02:08:02,083
We're not gonna drink, swear or smoke. 

1084
02:08:02,511 --> 02:08:08,641
But if you want to do this by your own,
please, don't invite us. 

1085
02:08:09,769 --> 02:08:14,935
We're saying goodbye to him today.

1086
02:08:18,777 --> 02:08:23,868
I thought, that we had at least 5 years in reserve.

1087
02:08:26,451 --> 02:08:31,534
I was so sure, that we had enough time to drink beer and talk.

1088
02:08:32,374 --> 02:08:39,511
But I just see your back,
with a sign "Don't miss me". 

1089
02:08:39,882 --> 02:08:43,997
Wait, stay for one more day. 

1090
02:08:49,142 --> 02:08:51,211
Goodbye, my friend

1091
02:08:56,732 --> 02:08:58,809
You're leaving so suddenly 

1092
02:09:04,906 --> 02:09:06,300
You're leaving without saying goodbye.

1093
02:09:06,490 --> 02:09:09,653
You're leaving unexpectedly. 

1094
02:09:09,912 --> 02:09:13,850
Well, goodbye, my friend. 

1095
02:09:49,699 --> 02:09:52,300
You know, all is not so bad. 

1096
02:09:52,620 --> 02:09:55,734
This style defeats fear. 

1097
02:09:56,290 --> 02:09:59,410
This is a wonderful wicked funny era.

1098
02:09:59,876 --> 02:10:02,982
don't turn us to dust.

1099
02:10:03,463 --> 02:10:06,609
Let us remember these people.

1100
02:10:07,300 --> 02:10:10,428
And the sharp edge of vinyl.

1101
02:10:11,053 --> 02:10:15,209
And may love save us.

1102
02:10:20,435 --> 02:10:23,435
Good-bye my friend

1103
02:10:28,548 --> 02:10:31,548
You're leaving so suddenly 

1104
02:10:35,661 --> 02:10:37,730
You're leaving without saying goodbye.

1105
02:10:37,850 --> 02:10:41,271
You're leaving unexpectedly. 

1106
02:10:41,333 --> 02:10:44,485
Goodbye dear friend.

1107
02:10:54,683 --> 02:11:17,003

The End.
