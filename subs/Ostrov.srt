1
00:01:36,280 --> 00:02:03,400
O Lord Jesus Christ Son of God,
have mercy on me, a sinner.

2
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:13,355
O Lord Jesus Christ Son of God,
have mercy on me, a sinner.

3
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,759
There's nobody here.

4
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,879
Don't shoot!
I give myself up.

5
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,475
Don't shoot!

6
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,680
- Where's your cap?
- What?

7
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,680
What?

8
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:49,756
- Where's your cap?
- Nicht verstehn!
I don't understand.

9
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,639
Don't, I understand.
He's here.

10
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,760
Don't beat me.

11
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,640
I'll show you where.
He's here.

12
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,520
He's here.
Right here.

13
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,479
Hey, Tikhon!
Tikhon, get out!

14
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,520
Get out, now!

15
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,351
That's him.

16
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,719
- How long?
- 20 minutes.
You are useless. Shoot!

17
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,640
- No!
Don't shoot me, please!

18
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:52,715
Don't shoot me!
Please! Don't shoot me.

19
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,359
Don't shoot me!

20
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,639
- Kill him. Be a man.
What d'ya want?

21
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,359
I can't.

22
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:43,630
I won't.

23
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:06,357
Didn't make it, did ya.
But I did. Yes.

24
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,640
Father, where is Father Anatoly?

25
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,599
- Sleeping.

26
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,520
- I see.

27
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,520
- He's sleeping.
- How long do we wait? We are tired.

28
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:59,594
Wait a little,
he'll come out before long.

29
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:17,114
What?
There'll be more sense
if you listen to the radio.

30
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,879
- Are you in trouble?
- Yes.

31
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:32,355
- A big trouble.
Don't cry. I'll ask him.

32
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:39,996
Perhaps he'll deign...
But then he's been in the sulks today.

33
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:46,640
- I'll not be in your debt.
- Put that away, you fool

34
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,599
- Don't let me see it again.
- Sorry.

35
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,520
Well then...

36
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:37,479
You want a blessing for murder?

37
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,280
Take this for a blessing.

38
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,920
Please, Father,

39
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,879
ask the blessing for an abortion
>from the holy man.

40
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:57,715
You are heading for hell
and want to drag me too?

41
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,280
I know

42
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,239
if I have a baby no one's gonna marry me.

43
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:14,040
- Who'll want me with a baby?
- No one'll want you without it.

44
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,999
It was preordained.

45
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,239
You'll have a baby...
For comfort.

46
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,520
Or you'll be cursing yourself all your life

47
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,400
that you killed an innocent child.

48
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,359
How do you know?
You are not a holy man.

49
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,114
Maybe I too...
killed a man.

50
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,760
Anyway, don't kneel before me.

51
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:53,630
Fall to your knees when you pray to God.

52
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:03,475
You'll have a boy.
A golden boy.

53
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,719
Now get out of my island!

54
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,996
O Lord, have mercy...

55
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,879
Glory be to Thee, O Lord

56
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,239
Glory be to Thee.

57
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:56,235
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,
and to the Holy Ghost,
for ever and ever. Amen.

58
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,520
Blessed be God for ever and ever. Amen.

59
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,160
Glory be to Thee, O Lord

60
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:10,680
Glory be to Thee.
Glory to the Father, and to the Son...

61
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,920
O all-holy Trinity, have mercy upon us.

62
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:19,400
- O Lord, wash away our sins...
- Remember, O Lord,

63
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:25,400
the soul of thy departed servant
the Warrior, Tikhon.

64
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,359
Pardon him every sin

65
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:36,596
and grant him the Kingdom of Heaven
and the Fount of everlasting Life

66
00:21:48,800 --> 00:22:07,596
O Lord Jesus Christ Son of God,
have mercy on this sinner.

67
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,520
O Lord, forsake me not...

68
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,280
Forsake me not, help me, O Lord.

69
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:26,920
Deliver my soul from the dungeon,
O Lord

70
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,920
Forsake me not.

71
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,754
Have mercy upon me, O Lord,

72
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,680
Wash me and I shall be whiter
than snow,

73
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,990
make me hear joy and gladness,

74
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,400
Wash me from my iniquity

75
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,280
and cleanse me from my sin.

76
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,113
Create in me a clean heart,

77
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:32,759
Cast me not away

78
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:45,680
Harken the prayers of our Holy Fathers,
O Lord Jesus Christ our God,

79
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:50,754
have mercy on us.

80
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:56,119
Hey, Father Anatoly,

81
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,400
somebody has soiled the handle.

82
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,400
Who could it be?
Must be some mean souls.

83
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,280
- Wipe it.
- In a minute.

84
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,640
Give me a rag to wipe my hand.

85
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,280
- I got none.
- Don't I give you rags
for your needs?

86
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,920
No rags really.
Go inside have a look.

87
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:23,640
- That if you don't mind
the soot, filth, coal.
- No matter.

88
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,400
I'm here on behalf of our
Father Superior, Filaret.

89
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,280
Get Father Filaret's blessing
and live in peace with him.

90
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,680
Live with a saint you'll become a saint.

91
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:37,639
You said something,
I don't get it.

92
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,920
Father Filaret shows his kindness
He wants you to live in his chamber

93
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,760
to mend your health.

94
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:51,680
- Who's gonna to work here?
- Lay brother Nicodimus.

95
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:57,755
- Why, he dreads fire.
- We all dread Gehenna.

96
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,920
Father Job,

97
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:05,280
bless me to stay here.
I'm used to it, I know all about it.

98
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:09,680
- It's winter. I need to stoke up.
- Do you hear me?

99
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,639
Father Filaret is showing
you kindness!

100
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,680
Look:

101
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:20,520
you learnt to read and write,
didn't you?

102
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,520
If I didn't I wouldn't be a chief.

103
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:30,595
- Read holy books too.
- Sure, I know it by heart.

104
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:38,040
I forget:

105
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:44,115
why Cain killed his brother Abel.

106
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:49,760
You and your jokes.
You'd better wipe that handle.

107
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,719
You're wallowing in filth, joker.

108
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,640
- It's sheer bliss...
- You are forever scaring me!

109
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,280
Where did you learn to walk
noiselessly?

110
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:20,920
If you like, I can make me horseshoes
so I'm always heard from a distance.

111
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,800
Just you dare!
This is a monastery, not stables.

112
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:30,875
If everybody wears horseshoes
there'll be such noise!
Like at a hippodrome.

113
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:40,630
Should I make bets on you?
What now?

114
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,800
Let me report...

115
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:53,876
- Father Anatoly...
- Father Anatoly? Not again!

116
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,920
It's all written here.

117
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:04,800
What do I want with your scrawl?
Say what you have to say.

118
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,400
And let's have done with this.

119
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:11,359
This is what in all honesty
can no longer be tolerated.

120
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:16,680
Firstly, Anatoly never washes
his face and hands.

121
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,680
Second, he is always late for work.

122
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:24,680
Third, Mainland folk are forever
coming to see him.
Yesterday he showed up in church

123
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:30,755
With a felt boot on one leg
and a sock on the other
and started singing through his nose.

124
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,879
Father: the brethren are grumbling.

125
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,920
On festive occasions he does come to church

126
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:43,400
but he doesn't pray, only exposes...

127
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:48,680
- He was barred from refectory...
- Enough. My head is spinning already.

128
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:52,040
Where is he now?

129
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,999
Where else?

130
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:05,359
In the boiler-room having tea with laymen.
With sugar!

131
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:10,280
- Shall I call him?
- No, I'll see him.

132
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,920
Did you tell him to quit his work
in the boiler-room

133
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:19,800
- and move in to my cell?
- I did.
- And?

134
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,800
He asked me

135
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:28,874
if I know why Cain killed Abel.

136
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,751
Why indeed?

137
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,800
- Are you trying to hurt me?
- Sorry.

138
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:42,875
- You can go, I'll sort it out with him.
- I mean well...
- Go, my good man, go.

139
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,359
And forgive me.

140
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,599
O Mother of God,

141
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,760
forgive this sinner,
save and keep me.

142
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,680
Give me and my brethren health
and strength.

143
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,478
May this day be joyful
and free of sin.

144
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,639
Forgive me, Mother of God.
Preserve my faith
and multiply my love for thee.

145
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:20,400
With my whole heart have I sought thee, O Lord.
O Lord, grant remission of their sins

146
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,040
unto all who have fallen asleep

147
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:29,640
in faith and the hope of resurrection,
O Mother of God,
Ever-blessed and undefiled,

148
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,599
more honored than the Cherubim,
and more glorious than the Seraphim,
we magnify thee.

149
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,035
Father!

150
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:40,479
Take this. All homemade.

151
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,760
Please pray for my late husband.

152
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,719
He was killed
in the Great Patriotic War.

153
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,879
Have a seat, sister. Let's have tea.
Sit down.

154
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,109
Now tell me your story.

155
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:13,119
He keeps coming in my sleep.

156
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,680
- What does he say?
- Nothing.

157
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,639
Just groans.

158
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:26,479
He must be feeling bad up there.

159
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:38,639
- Did you love him?
- I still do.

160
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:45,640
We'd been together just six months.
Then he was recruited.

161
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,599
I've been widowed for 30 years now.

162
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,995
Very well.
Given such love, it'll do no harm to ask.

163
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,760
I'll go see Father Anatoly.

164
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:11,632
He is not a saint but well-read.
He may give some useful advice.

165
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,999
Come over here.

166
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:23,680
While I'm talking to him -
I'll open the door - you
Stand here and listen.

167
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,639
Just be quiet.

168
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,471
- What's his name?
- Mikhail.

169
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,400
Father Anatoly,

170
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:53,475
a widow here asks you to pray
for the repose of
a fallen warrior, Mikhail.

171
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:01,400
What an idea!
A requiem for the living!

172
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:08,476
She says he laid down his life
in battle in '44.

173
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,920
He laid down nothing.
He was captured.

174
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,760
After Victory he stayed in France.

175
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:24,920
He's ailing now. Wants to see his first,
beloved wife before he dies.

176
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,879
What are you doing here? Go away.

177
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:44,400
Did you hear?
No requiem for the living, he says.

178
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:50,920
Your man is alive but ailing.
You gotta go to France.

179
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:57,760
To comfort the ailing man before he dies
and close his eyes.

180
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,719
Don't stare at me, do it.

181
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,280
What are you saying, Father?

182
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:13,231
- Me? To France?
- Why not? People live in France too.

183
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:18,800
Impossible.
It's a capitalist country.
They won't let me out.

184
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,800
No fear. If Father Anatoly says so,
they will.

185
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:29,400
But there's my household, cow...
My pig needs to be slaughtered.

186
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:35,475
- Sell it all, lock, stock and barrel.
- AII?
- Lock, stock and barrel.

187
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:44,640
Sell it, you won't be sorry.

188
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:50,680
They'll give a lot of money for your pig.
It's a good pig.

189
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:57,680
If I ate meat I'd buy it.
I would.

190
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,160
You must be kidding, Father.

191
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,640
Do you love your husband?

192
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,110
Then go and do
what was preordained.

193
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:15,594
Don't upset me, go!

194
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:46,640
Forgive me and have mercy!

195
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:52,715
Direct me on my way, O Lord!

196
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:14,920
For I am weak in soul.
And weak in body - yea!

197
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:19,710
And of sinful passions
Am I a vicious slave.

198
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,680
Can't you adjust the prop?

199
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,355
Your laundry's on the ground.

200
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,599
Not too many of you today.

201
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,640
What are you doing here?

202
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,760
Writing a petition to our heavenly King...

203
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:58,400
...to survive the winter.
It's hard for brethren to cut
a grave through permafrost.

204
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,359
Thank God you're joking again,
I feared you'd gone mad.

205
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,719
Look, it's sailing.

206
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,639
Pray for me, Father Anatoly.

207
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:25,040
You should pray for me.
I'm three times as sinful as you.

208
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,999
What are you saying?

209
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,160
You don't like me, Father Job.

210
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,280
Filaret does, and you...

211
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,239
are trying to please him.

212
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,680
Why should I love you?

213
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,800
You never pass my cell without a prank.

214
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,160
Now you soil the door handle,
now you plant some trash.

215
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:56,235
Don't I know about my sins
without your hints?

216
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:08,476
Okay...
Forget it, brother.
And forgive this sinner.

217
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:16,239
- Tired?
- No, no.
- Fine.

218
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:23,119
- Let me carry you.
- No, I can manage.

219
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:29,359
- Careful.
- I can do it.
- Yes, of course.

220
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,358
Careful.

221
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,356
Careful.

222
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,879
Mind his leg!

223
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,920
He fell from a shed roof.
Broke his leg.

224
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:30,800
His hip is rotting now.

225
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,520
Four operations but it didn't help.

226
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:39,520
We've seen all sorts of professors
and surgeons...

227
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:45,117
- I'm hot, mum.
- The Father will help us.

228
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,920
- No one is able to help
and his hip is rotting.
- Sit down.

229
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:54,879
You are tired.

230
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:00,879
- What's the boy's name?
- Vanechka.

231
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:08,714
This good man will help us.

232
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,239
Let's take the crutches away.

233
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,520
Get up,

234
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,636
I'll move the block a little.

235
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,232
Put him on the block.

236
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,680
- Don't be afraid.
- Won't it hurt him?

237
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:50,355
Hold him.

238
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,760
My angel...

239
00:45:54,760 --> 00:46:00,920
Vanechka,
I'm going to pray to God,

240
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:04,879
you pray too, in your own words.

241
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,280
Ask the Lord to heal your leg.

242
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:13,800
He's kind, he'll help.

243
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:17,040
He will.

244
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,760
My dearest...

245
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,876
Just stand still.

246
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,599
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

247
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:44,119
Glory be to you, O Lord.

248
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,638
O Heavenly King, Comforter,
and Spirit of Truth,

249
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:58,160
Come and take up Your abode in us,
and cleanse us from every stain,

250
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:04,235
- : and save our souls.
- Ask the Lord.

251
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:17,359
Please help me and heal my leg.

252
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,040
We are praying to you, our God.

253
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:42,680
Visit your grace on
your servant John,

254
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:46,400
forgive him all transgressions

255
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:51,160
Send down your healing strength

256
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,520
On his flesh.

257
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,800
Put the fire out, quench all heat
And creeping illness.

258
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,760
Heal thy servant John.

259
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:06,920
Please, O dear God!
Raise him from his sick bed,

260
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:12,400
Bring him to thy Church
That he may understand thy will

261
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:18,640
Glory be to the Father,

262
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,160
and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost,

263
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:27,235
For ever and ever,

264
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,800
Glory be to Thee, O Lord.

265
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:47,680
O Lord, succour John,

266
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,800
heal his leg.

267
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:53,760
God Almighty,

268
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,228
succour the suffering and the sick.

269
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,999
I trust in Thee, O Lord.

270
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:23,160
Now you'll be alright, Vanechka.

271
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:27,800
- Come on, have a go.
- No, he can't.

272
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,400
- Yes, he can.
- Try it.

273
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,160
- Careful.
- Hold it, hold it.

274
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,920
Look, he's walking.

275
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:40,879
Good boy.

276
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:47,280
You won't need
the crutches anymore.

277
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,680
Forget about them.

278
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,160
Come over to me, angel.

279
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:57,160
My boy, my golden boy.

280
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:02,280
- We'll be going now, and thanks.
- Going?

281
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:07,520
You should stay the night at the monastery.
Tomorrow Father Filaret

282
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:11,920
will give your boy communion
and he'll never-ever limp.

283
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:17,400
I can't stay.
I need to go to work.

284
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:24,476
- D'ya think I'm playing games
with you?
- I've got a ticket.

285
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,760
What's more important

286
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,520
your son or your work?

287
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,800
But I got to go to work.

288
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:41,876
Get out of my sight.
Leave!

289
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,280
Wait! Wait!

290
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,680
Come back!

291
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,639
Go ashore!

292
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:17,109
Wait!

293
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,640
What do you think you are doing?

294
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,640
There, my boy.

295
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,280
- What are you up to?
- lf you don't think about yourself,

296
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,590
think about your boy.

297
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:42,989
- Vanya!
- Come, Vanya, have no fear.

298
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:52,640
- I'll be fired.
- You like your work?

299
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,760
I love it.

300
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:00,160
Our design bureau is commissioning
a project and we even work overnight.

301
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:06,520
A pipe's broken there,
the staff's on 3-days leave without pay.

302
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:09,800
- How can you know?
- Why are you lying?

303
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:13,040
I am not lying. When you find out
it'll be too late.

304
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,760
Go, woman. I have no time for you.

305
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,400
- Another row?
- Look...

306
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,640
take the boy,

307
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:28,400
settle him for the night.
Tomorrow Father Filaret
will give him communion.

308
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,359
Whose boy is he?

309
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,640
What do we do now?

310
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,640
- Is it your boy?
- Yes.

311
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,632
Where do we go now?

312
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,752
Come with me.

313
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,640
Blessed is the man

314
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:53,520
that walks not in the counsel
of the ungodly,

315
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,680
nor stands in the way of sinners,

316
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:00,280
nor sits in the seat of the scornful:

317
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:04,114
but whose delight is
in the Will of the Lord;

318
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:15,160
And he shall be like a tree planted
by the fount of eternal life

319
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:19,119
that brings forth fruit in season;

320
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:26,596
And whose leaf shall not wither;
whatsoever he does shall prosper.

321
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,479
Not so are the ungodly;
They are like chaff

322
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,800
Blown by the wind.

323
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:41,477
Therefore the ungodly shall not stand
in the judgement,

324
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:48,680
nor sinners in
the council of the righteous.

325
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:52,639
but the way of the ungodly
leads nowhere.

326
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:40,719
- What are you doing there?
- Lying in wait for you.

327
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:47,759
Why the charred log?

328
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,680
It just leaped out of my hands.
I didn't mean it.

329
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,920
I see.

330
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:56,879
- No, you don't.
- Come down.

331
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:02,874
- No, I'm fine where I am.
- I've got complaints about you.

332
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:10,040
The proud are risen against me
and violent men have sought my soul.

333
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:13,999
What do you think I should do
about this, prankster?

334
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,800
Marvelous are your deeds,
O Lord!

335
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:24,520
I hear you are cultivating superstitions
and tempting brethren and laymen.

336
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:28,160
Safeguard me from worldly slander...

337
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,400
Forget prayers and use your brains.

338
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,400
Being your superior
I am duty-bound to punish you.

339
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,359
The Lord is my light

340
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:42,599
- Whom shall I fear?
- Just you wait, prankster.

341
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:46,639
You'll reap the benefits
of your doings.

342
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:53,755
In God is my salvation
and my comfort.

343
00:56:55,040 --> 00:57:00,400
Forgive me and have mercy!

344
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:05,680
Direct me on thy way,
O Lord!

345
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:11,280
For my soul is weak
And so is my body

346
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:17,355
I am the slave of sinful passions

347
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:39,115
- Father Anatoly is looking
the wrong way.
- Turn him the right way.

348
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:58,400
Fire, brethren, fire!

349
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:04,236
Put it out!
We are putting it out.

350
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:27,160
You knew about the fire, didn't you?
No one can know this but God.

351
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:31,520
You threw a charred log
at my feet. I remember.

352
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:35,920
Many mourn for the righteous,
Father Filaret.
Why didn't you just say it?

353
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,680
Why those charred logs?
I'm an ordinary man,

354
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:42,280
I don't understand your signs.

355
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:49,160
- lf you are slandered for Christ’s sake,
Then the Spirit of God dwells in you.
- Answer me!

356
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,400
I am your superior!

357
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:55,400
Blessed are ye who are persecuted

358
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:59,996
- and slandered for my sake...
- Say no more.

359
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:07,800
Through your prayers, Father,
we have put out the fire.

360
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,920
Your cell is burnt a bit but we saved the hen.

361
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:14,879
Enough!

362
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:18,800
Cackling like a hen.

363
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:21,920
You are not in your office,
but in the house of God!

364
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:25,760
Let's not discuss worldly matters here.

365
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:29,719
Temples love prayer.

366
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:34,639
- Holy Father!
- Forgive me, brother Job.
I went too far

367
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:37,040
It was your lay brother, Amvrosy.

368
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:41,760
...he filled a lamp with oil, struck a match
and dropped it.
- Got it.

369
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:45,719
We'll fix it in no time.

370
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:49,760
I'll tell you what Father Anatoly.

371
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,160
I never wanted to be a Father Superior.

372
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:58,235
I wanted to live in the wilderness
As a recluse

373
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:02,599
I take the fire as a sign for me
to become a hermit:

374
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:07,280
- What do you think?
- I'm not a learned man, I don't think anything.

375
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:10,280
I'm here to share your cell with you

376
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:14,239
while mine is being restored.
Will you accept me?

377
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,280
It's up to you to decide.

378
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:21,239
- Where do you sleep?
- Right here.

379
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:26,119
- Here? On the coals?
Yes. On the coals.

380
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,631
You can sleep next to me.

381
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:38,636
Good.
We'll save ourselves together
and pray jointly.

382
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:44,750
And think about God and life eternal.

383
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:52,280
Mind you, I'm a troublesome
bed-fellow. I have coughing fits.

384
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:54,640
Sometimes I suddenly want to sing

385
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:59,714
in the dead of night.
You won't mind?

386
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:03,040
I've long wanted to ask you,
prankster.

387
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:08,280
Why do you behave improperly
during the service?

388
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:11,760
You should pray
in the prescribed way.

389
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,680
If everyone starts prays
in his own way,

390
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,760
where will we be?

391
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:21,719
What will be left of the church?

392
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:27,040
Father Filaret,

393
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:32,520
- you've got nice boots.
- You like them?
- Very.

394
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:35,040
- Soft, ain't they?
- Oh yes.

395
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:38,999
The only boots I can wear.
His Beatitude gave them to me
out of kindness.

396
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:43,239
He knows I have bad feet.

397
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:48,280
And your blanket's even better.
His Beatitude too?

398
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:54,355
No, I got it in Greece
when the Metropolitan and I
were on a pilgrimage to Afon.

399
01:04:56,280 --> 01:05:00,239
Well... let's go to sleep.

400
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:43,359
What are you doing,
Father Anatoly?

401
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:51,119
I'm reading the book of human sins.

402
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:58,716
When I'm through, I'll shove it in the stove...
and sin will be no more.

403
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:06,800
What the hell are you doing?

404
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:12,875
I'm going to read the second page.

405
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:17,479
Page? It's my boots.

406
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:22,400
Another one gone.

407
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,520
Didn’t you know

408
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:30,280
: most sins nest
in bishops' boot tops?

409
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:34,239
Clown!

410
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,639
Why is it locked?

411
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:10,589
- We are going to drive demons out.
- What demons?

412
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:15,990
- They are all around us,
don't you see?
- Open up Immediately.

413
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:25,110
Demons don't like smoke.
We're gonna smoke them out.

414
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:33,876
- Look where that one got to.
And another one.
- You are the demon.

415
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:38,999
Look! Here they are.
A breeding nest...

416
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:50,599
Damn them.

417
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:55,040
Out, out with you!

418
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:58,999
- But we're going to be gassed.
- It's almost over

419
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:03,239
- We'll get rid of them all.
- We're going to be gassed.

420
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:10,040
- Just wait a second.
- Why'd you shut the air vent?

421
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:13,400
You want me dead!

422
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:16,920
- Wait.
- Air, air!
- They're almost all gone.

423
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,478
Get out you.

424
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,470
We did it.

425
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:35,359
Oh, I forgot the chief demon.

426
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:44,119
Small but so vicious.

427
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,640
Why are you looking at me?

428
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:42,596
Mean, ain't I?

429
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,710
That's what I am.

430
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:53,800
I bear you no grudge, brother.

431
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:56,520
I am grateful to you, brother.

432
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:03,640
I really am.
You've delivered me from things
superficial and unnecessary.

433
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:08,800
I was really attached
to those boots and that blanket,

434
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:14,875
and you removed them from me.
Thank you.

435
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:23,356
And you've shown me
there's little faith in me.

436
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:32,716
I got real scared.
I'm going to meet death in his stokehole,
I thought.

437
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:39,639
I feared death
because I had little faith.

438
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:45,759
It means I am not ready
to meet Our Lord.

439
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:52,359
I was afraid to face death unrepented.

440
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:59,754
There's little virtue in me
but much sin.

441
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:04,800
Virtue?

442
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:10,920
My virtues stink before the Lord.

443
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:17,040
- I can really smell the stench.
- Yes, smell it and through that:

444
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:20,999
...and you'll be saved.

445
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:28,760
I wonder why me.

446
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:34,640
Why has God chosen me
to lead the community?

447
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:38,599
I should be hanged for my sins

448
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:42,520
Instead I was made almost a saint.

449
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:44,590
What is there saintly in me?

450
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:50,228
There's no peace in my heart.

451
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:36,116
Tikhon!

452
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:44,640
Tikhon Petrovich,

453
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:49,760
can you hear me?

454
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:54,680
You know all my life.

455
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:57,680
I'm suffering torments.

456
01:12:57,680 --> 01:13:02,754
I can't live and I can't die.

457
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:12,479
My spirit was frail.

458
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:19,632
I've been carrying this sin for years
It never releases me, not even
for one second.

459
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:23,280
I know you forgave me?

460
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,680
Pray that God

461
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:29,639
take this burden off my chest.

462
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:56,680
The spoors clanging.

463
01:13:56,680 --> 01:14:00,639
Yes, we are moving.

464
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:08,160
I don't want your tea.

465
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:12,119
I do.

466
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:16,800
Why'd you give me that look, dad?

467
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:22,875
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

468
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:29,920
Don't you love me at all?

469
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:33,760
Why, I do love you, my little girl.

470
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:37,719
You're lying. You don't.

471
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:50,920
I can't sit here.

472
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:52,920
I can't sit here.

473
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:55,115
- I don't want to sit here.
- What's wrong, little girl?

474
01:14:57,160 --> 01:15:01,119
Why do you keep me under lock?

475
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:05,280
- What?
- Comrade Admiral, I...
- What do you want?

476
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:09,239
I'm sorry...

477
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:55,239
You think I'm sick?

478
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:58,400
Of course not.

479
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:00,920
You are tired

480
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:05,994
you need a good rest.

481
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:12,589
But I am sick.

482
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:23,870
Very sick.

483
01:16:56,280 --> 01:17:03,356
O Lord Jesus Christ,
have mercy on us.

484
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:06,710
Amen.

485
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:32,999
Why did you send me that incense?

486
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:38,520
- There'll be a funeral on Wednesday.
- Whose funeral?

487
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:41,353
His whom the Lord has chosen.

488
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:46,680
The waves of death

489
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:52,760
have washed over me
and deadly nets have enmeshed me.

490
01:17:52,760 --> 01:18:00,474
Do you really want to die?

491
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,040
I'll get you a coffin.

492
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:07,520
Oak? Pine? You name it.
It doesn't matter.

493
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:11,479
- It's not necessary.
I have one already.
- Where is it?

494
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:15,639
On the porch. See that box over there?

495
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:22,115
You can't even die like a human being.

496
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:26,719
Why don't we order a proper coffin?

497
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:31,040
I want the box, Father. The box.

498
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:34,999
That's my will.

499
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:38,280
What kind of person are you?

500
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:40,640
You even can't die without tricks.

501
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,640
All men lie in coffins,

502
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:46,400
even the venerable saints.

503
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:50,160
But he wants a box with ropes.

504
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:56,040
That's vanity.

505
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:58,110
Vanity!

506
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:05,639
You actually like me, Father Job,

507
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:09,594
don't you?

508
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:20,875
I can't stomach you, old fogy.

509
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:28,640
You asked me why Cain killed Abel.
I'll tell you.

510
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:32,520
I tried to help others like you

511
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:36,479
but the Lord wouldn't accept
my sacrifice.

512
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:43,470
Oh, why am I talking to you?

513
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:47,233
Wait.

514
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:54,239
When I die will you weep for me?

515
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:46,719
What's with you, Nastya?

516
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:59,879
Having fun, Father Anatoly?

517
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:16,760
I hear you prankster
are preparing to die.

518
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:19,640
So they've told you.

519
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:23,599
I don't want to lose you.

520
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:28,040
I am wondering

521
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:31,999
Whether it I should tonsure you.

522
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:34,640
What do you mean?

523
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:40,040
I've lived an earthly life
I avoided the Law

524
01:22:40,040 --> 01:22:42,520
and should I now give up everything?

525
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:48,040
Father, forget it.
That's out of the question.
What are you talking about?

526
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:54,160
Sins. Burning sins.
They've burnt my heart out.

527
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:57,400
You are speaking in riddles again,
brother.

528
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:04,476
There is no sin the Lord cannot pardon
Nothing is impossible for Him.

529
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:25,750
That's enough.

530
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:43,160
You didn't come on your own, right?

531
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:47,119
- My dad's... over there.
- And the name is...

532
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:53,160
- Nastya.
- Not yours, your father's.

533
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:57,040
Tikhon Petrovich.
He's an admiral.

534
01:23:57,040 --> 01:24:00,160
Admiral?

535
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:04,119
I'm glad he's an admiral.

536
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:12,359
You can go hang around here.
I'll be back.

537
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:26,475
I'm sorry, she is sick.

538
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:30,520
What's wrong with you?

539
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:34,040
Can I help you?

540
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:41,680
No, thanks. Angels are singing
in my heart.
Sorry:

541
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:44,400
she is not quite herself.

542
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:48,160
I've taken her to doctors.
We even went to Moscow.

543
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:50,920
Nothing's helped.

544
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:55,920
I hear there's a holy man here
at the monastery.

545
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:59,400
If he can't help
I don't know who can.

546
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:03,359
- How long has she been like that?
- Four years and a half

547
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:06,680
since her husband died.

548
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:09,640
He was a submariner
in the Barents Sea.

549
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:13,599
Tell, me. Can your holy man

550
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:16,680
Can he heal the insane?

551
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:20,520
- She is not insane.
- What's with her?

552
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:22,640
She's possessed.

553
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:28,400
There's a demon inside her
who torments her.
It sounds absurd. Forgive me.

554
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:33,800
- How do you know?
- I know him personally.
- Who?

555
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,870
The demon.

556
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:44,920
Nastya, where are you?

557
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:48,754
Nastya! Let's get out of here.

558
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:03,719
Hey, Nastya!

559
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:13,119
Come out. We've arrived.

560
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:19,520
- I'm not going with you.
- You have to, sweetie.
- No. I'm tired.

561
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:23,479
You go, I'll stay here.

562
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:27,879
I'm not coming with you.

563
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:34,990
You are a nasty person.

564
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:41,350
And your island is nasty.

565
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:44,760
I'm not coming with you.

566
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:47,520
- You have to.
- You have to. Don't be afraid.

567
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:51,280
- I'm not coming
- You’ll be fine.

568
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:54,590
I don't want to go.

569
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:46,599
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

570
01:28:55,040 --> 01:29:01,115
O Lord Jesus Christ,
thy will be done.

571
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:21,400
The Lord shall rise,

572
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:24,040
and His enemies shall be dispersed,

573
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:26,640
and vanish like smoke.

574
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:31,920
As wax melts before fire,
so will the devils perish
before those who love God

575
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:36,520
Before those who make the
sign of the cross
and say joyfully.

576
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:40,160
Precious and Life-giving Cross

577
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:45,996
which drives away demons...

578
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:57,160
O most Pure and Life-giving Cross
of the Lord,

579
01:29:57,160 --> 01:30:04,236
help me with the Holy Virgin the Mother
of God and with all Saints forever and
ever. Amen.

580
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:23,634
O Lord, succour the sick. Amen.

581
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:46,999
Now you are well.

582
01:32:56,760 --> 01:33:00,719
Have a good cry.

583
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:50,520
Thank you.
I don't know how
I can thank you enough.

584
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:53,520
Nastya is shining.

585
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:57,800
We should thank God.

586
01:33:57,800 --> 01:34:04,876
Now go to the church.
Nastya should confess her sins
and receive communion.

587
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:16,160
- Don't you want to confess?
- I don't understand.

588
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:18,230
Come, I'll explain it to you.

589
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:34,800
Don't be afraid, Admiral.

590
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:40,875
No one is going to test your
loyalty to the Party.

591
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:45,280
I am not afraid of anyone

592
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:49,239
I've had my share of fear.

593
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:56,115
But I really don't see
what this is about.

594
01:34:57,640 --> 01:35:03,760
In '42 I was taken prisoner.
I was still in my teens.

595
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:06,400
The Germans promised me:

596
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:12,475
...if in exchange... er
if I shot my mate.

597
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:22,160
- Where did you serve?
- Here in the Northern fleet.

598
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:27,760
- What was the guy's name?
- I don't remember.

599
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:34,632
He was older than me.
A skipper on a tugboat.

600
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:47,800
Why don't you ask if I shot him?

601
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:54,876
- Well, did you?
- I did.

602
01:35:56,640 --> 01:36:00,599
I don't know how to live with it.

603
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:05,759
Me neither.

604
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:13,996
- Why did you tell me?
- I am old

605
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:21,280
and afraid to die with this sin.
I'm scared.

606
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:27,879
Don't be afraid.
Die at ease, Father.

607
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:34,119
I know the man.

608
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:38,759
He survived.

609
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:42,800
You just shot

610
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:46,759
...through his arm.

611
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:54,680
Then there was a blast,
he fell overboard and grabbed a plank.

612
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:59,754
He was rescued the next morning.

613
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:08,599
Forgive me.

614
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:15,520
You are forgiven.

615
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:19,479
I was sure you hadn't survived.

616
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:33,475
Tikhon, go in peace.

617
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:35,990
God bless you.

618
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:12,879
Thank you, brothers.

619
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:22,520
Good job.
We sand-papered it first,
then varnished.

620
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:29,280
You can well use it as a sideboard.
Like it?

621
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:35,355
I need a coffin, not a sideboard.

622
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:42,640
I tried to please you.

623
01:39:42,640 --> 01:39:46,599
Nothing ever pleases you.

624
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:55,640
I can get some sandpaper and
we'll scratch it off or dirty
it with your coal.

625
01:39:55,640 --> 01:40:00,680
Tell me what you want.
I'll do it for you.

626
01:40:00,680 --> 01:40:07,280
Father Job, Forgive me, an old fool.

627
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:13,355
- Forgive me the soot and Cain
and this sideboard.
- It is OK.

628
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:16,800
- Forgive me for Christ’s sake.
- Let bygones be bygones.

629
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:21,800
- You pardon me.
- I've been unjust to you.

630
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:26,520
- Pardon me for Christ’s sake.
- God will.

631
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:28,040
Glory be to Thee, O Lord.

632
01:40:28,040 --> 01:40:32,400
Watch me.
I'll take a chunk of coal...

633
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:37,920
See that?

634
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:40,753
Just what you wish,

635
01:40:55,160 --> 01:40:59,119
Father Job, give me a hand.

636
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:22,760
Here I am.

637
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:27,760
Go tell Father Filaret

638
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:33,630
the servant of God Anatoly
has departed this life.

639
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:42,714
Father Anatoly...
Aren't you afraid to die?

640
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:48,594
I'm not afraid to die.

641
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:54,995
I'm afraid to stand before God.
Sins are oppressing me.

642
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:58,756
How should I live?

643
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:03,999
We are all sinners.
Live the way you can.

644
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:07,920
Just try not to sin too much.

645
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:12,520
Well, enough of that.
Enough talking. Go:

646
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:15,400
...my dear, go.

647
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:17,231
God be with you.

648
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:03,995
O Lord... receive my sinful soul.
