1
00:00:36,084 --> 00:00:36,178
Weeell.What do broadcasters promise us for tomorrow?

2
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:45,899
Weeell...The comrades broadcasters promise us tomorrow 20 degrees. Above 0, so not bad..Changing cloudness, warm wind north-west.

3
00:00:46,552 --> 00:00:50,950
For somebody going to be bright, for somebody not..The weather in Piter is changing with a cosmic speed.

4
00:00:51,179 --> 00:01:00,818
And with it changes the mood. So for the emotion stabilization, breathe deep and stay on our line, it's an excellent place by the way. Stand here, don't move..

5
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:07,302
And..let's get acquainted: Me, Masha Emelianova and you are listening to

6
00:01:55,045 --> 00:01:56,992
Maybe something from a new collection?..

7
00:01:59,716 --> 00:02:00,852
Cool, isn't it?..Very good choice..

8
00:02:02,602 --> 00:02:03,944
You like?..

9
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,276
No?

10
00:02:10,346 --> 00:02:12,238
Tell me, why are all these mannequins bald?

11
00:02:12,655 --> 00:02:20,763
..You don't know?? It is a new style! The last fashion tendency!

12
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:30,345
Yes my sweet, yes honey..What we are doing? Drawing little pretty houses

13
00:02:30,809 --> 00:02:33,387
Which beer? No, I'm alone..

14
00:02:33,669 --> 00:02:36,512
Which Ira?

15
00:02:47,317 --> 00:02:51,701
Here you are..

16
00:03:11,435 --> 00:03:12,559
Colour.

17
00:03:12,904 --> 00:03:14,113
Voice.

18
00:03:14,437 --> 00:03:15,671
Taste.

19
00:03:15,967 --> 00:03:20,951
Interesting girl..

20
00:03:21,278 --> 00:03:25,015
Everyday for you..Masha Emelianova

21
00:03:25,264 --> 00:03:26,264
Piter FM on air.

22
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,567
And we're continuing our concert.

23
00:03:28,828 --> 00:03:35,232
Fedor and Victor are congratulating their friend Maxim Vasiliev on winning an international competition of young architects.

24
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,312
Maxim came to be best of the best.

25
00:03:37,514 --> 00:03:39,390
And attention!

26
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,108
He's leaving for Berlin!!

27
00:03:41,108 --> 00:03:42,963
Max, you've heard?

28
00:03:43,202 --> 00:03:49,124
But this is the official version, but I think Mr. Vasiliev is going there for beer. Don't forget, Maxim, beer makes the tummy grow.

29
00:03:49,426 --> 00:03:54,828
Uph, guys, well..thanks.

30
00:03:55,688 --> 00:03:57,266
Do you know any German girls?..

31
00:03:57,593 --> 00:04:04,047
Of course. Clara Tsetkin..

32
00:04:04,892 --> 00:04:07,813
Sings cool..

33
00:04:08,032 --> 00:04:15,352
I also can sing like that..

34
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:36,344
Hi, Mashka!

35
00:04:36,642 --> 00:04:37,876
Hi!

36
00:04:38,096 --> 00:04:39,282
The soul is singing?..

37
00:04:42,017 --> 00:04:43,378
What's that?

38
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,691
Is that Our format??

39
00:04:45,973 --> 00:04:48,283
..Yeah.. Changing our orientation..

40
00:04:48,492 --> 00:04:53,081
Mash, I just can't understand..what for you are searching for trouble? Let them listen for their Kirkorov (pop). They like it..

41
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,431
And I don't..

42
00:04:54,657 --> 00:04:57,297
And why are you late?

43
00:04:57,501 --> 00:04:59,691
This wedding..,

44
00:05:02,675 --> 00:05:08,986

45
00:05:09,253 --> 00:05:10,992
Nee.. I'm dying..

46
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:12,536
Just one hour, please.

47
00:05:12,536 --> 00:05:15,368
Ok, but Only one hour..Promise!..

48
00:05:15,612 --> 00:05:17,690
It is cool now in Berlin.

49
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,925
In Berlin it is always cool..

50
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:29,565
Why you go? Why not me instead?..

51
00:05:29,895 --> 00:05:33,403
Don't be jealous so loudly,OK?..

52
00:05:33,678 --> 00:05:34,566
Who is jealous?

53
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:43,581
He doesn't speak even a bit of German! Tell Gastarbeiter, tell gastarbeiter!

54
00:05:43,786 --> 00:05:46,535
And the mansard? You'll leave it to me?

55
00:05:46,535 --> 00:05:48,895
And you'll work as a street-cleaner?

56
00:05:48,895 --> 00:05:50,505
..No.

57
00:05:50,848 --> 00:05:53,926
And Marina, is she aware already?

58
00:05:54,148 --> 00:05:56,583
And when you are going to organize you farewell night?

59
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:58,460
..Tomorrow..

60
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,165
No, I'm serious..

61
00:06:01,165 --> 00:06:06,535

Attention! Mortal trick!

64
00:06:13,237 --> 00:06:16,271
Recognizing the handwriting of Master.

65
00:06:16,271 --> 00:06:18,865
Is it undangerous for life?..

66
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,270
Don't know, but Kostia likes that..

67
00:06:21,475 --> 00:06:24,770
Have you already fed Krosha?

68
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:34,865
..Oh, I forgot. Have a snack, my little.

69
00:06:36,755 --> 00:06:37,507

Me too.

71
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,272
Who are you?

72
00:06:40,272 --> 00:06:44,070
Saniok. I'm listening to your voice every day. You are so..

73
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,912

Who's that?

79
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,890
Awful.

80
00:07:01,243 --> 00:07:03,085
Fans don't leave in peace?

81
00:07:03,085 --> 00:07:06,413
..Maniacs..!

82
00:07:06,413 --> 00:07:08,022
Careful!

83
00:07:17,491 --> 00:07:20,054
Come here

84
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:24,210

85
00:07:25,406 --> 00:07:29,648
You see that one, with flowers?..Mine..

86
00:07:30,164 --> 00:07:32,776
Funny! What's the name?

87
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:40,228
Dima I think..Yesterday hardly got rid of him. Waiting..Knows that my ephire ended

88
00:07:40,696 --> 00:07:47,024
Emelianova, after the programme to my room!..

00:09:53,311 --> 00:09:57,844
..Hello, Masha?.. Sorry..

92
00:10:19,514 --> 00:10:19,658
Hi

93
00:10:20,171 --> 00:10:24,006
Hi..Where have you been? I'm here for half an hour..

94
00:10:24,295 --> 00:10:26,328
I could not come before really..

95
00:10:26,546 --> 00:10:28,516
You hired a secretary?

96
00:10:28,719 --> 00:10:29,898
What you mean?

97
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:33,125
I don't know ..What the man is answering your phone?

98
00:10:33,428 --> 00:10:35,828
Damn..

99
00:10:36,655 --> 00:10:39,859
Yeah, even a week did not pass.

100
00:10:40,094 --> 00:10:41,335
I didn't even notice..

101
00:10:41,546 --> 00:10:44,242
I gave you a new Samsung.

102
00:10:44,507 --> 00:10:47,522
Don't put it on I asked you..

103
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:48,985
Give me your phone.

104
00:10:49,235 --> 00:10:50,828
You'll lose it as well?

105
00:10:51,096 --> 00:10:52,722
..Of course.

106
00:10:55,796 --> 00:11:01,421
Hi, my phone is in good hands?

107
00:11:01,751 --> 00:11:03,220
Yes, Masha, you are lucky.

108
00:11:03,988 --> 00:11:05,704
How do you know my name?

109
00:11:06,344 --> 00:11:08,593
There've been calls only to Masha..

110
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,531
And your name?

111
00:11:10,734 --> 00:11:13,049
Maxim. How can I give it back to you?

112
00:11:14,658 --> 00:11:18,331
You know, today I could come to meet you at about 9 pm, under the monument.

113
00:11:18,532 --> 00:11:20,173
Ok, how I'll recognize you?

114
00:11:20,409 --> 00:11:24,837
Easily, I'll be dressed in a Hare costume.

115
00:11:25,175 --> 00:11:27,596
Joking..Can I call you later?

116
00:11:27,596 --> 00:11:28,958
Yes, of course.

117
00:11:29,362 --> 00:11:30,472
..What happened?

118
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:32,119
Nothing.

119
00:11:32,408 --> 00:11:34,052
Where is again my fault?

120
00:11:34,052 --> 00:11:35,852
Nothing..

121
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:41,597
Otello! A real moor!

122
00:11:41,597 --> 00:11:44,221
Let's go buy rings, otherwise I'll be late for job..

123
00:11:44,221 --> 00:11:47,037
Take off this horror from your head..

124
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:49,706
Take it off, I'll throw it away..

125
00:11:50,051 --> 00:11:52,817
As for me I like it...

126
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,934
I'm delighted.

127
00:12:11,207 --> 00:12:16,647
You are very talented.

128
00:12:17,786 --> 00:12:23,863
Invitation. Go to the consulate tomorrow morning!

129
00:12:25,491 --> 00:12:33,396
Contract. You have 2 days to study it..

130
00:12:36,912 --> 00:12:37,614
Sorry..

131
00:12:42,568 --> 00:12:44,693
Yes Marina..

132
00:12:44,693 --> 00:12:45,772
Yes I called,

00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:55,037

135
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:57,288
At 10.00?..

00:12:57,537 --> 00:12:59,178
Yes Masha. A second..Yes Marina, You have the keys? Okay. Sorry. Can not speak right now.

137

Hello, yes Masha. Yes..So I can recognize you by..?

138
00:13:12,616 --> 00:13:15,819
A birthmark on your back?

139
00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:18,747
..Yes, I can wait..Sorry..

140
00:13:18,747 --> 00:13:25,271
Women..Isn't it a pity for you to leave them?

141
00:13:25,476 --> 00:13:30,210
I understand..

142
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:38,929
I'll have a red jacket ..Not tall..

143
00:13:39,227 --> 00:13:42,335
Okay..See you.

144
00:13:43,124 --> 00:13:44,631
Who's that?

145
00:13:46,711 --> 00:13:50,179
I lost my mobile..He found..

146
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:52,227
Now wants to give it back.

147
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,272
Is he good-looking?

148
00:13:54,272 --> 00:13:56,492
And this is the thing I didn't ask..

149
00:13:56,695 --> 00:14:00,353
And does he know that you work on the radio? No..

150
00:14:00,353 --> 00:14:02,823
Don't say.. This Dima got me already.

151
00:14:02,823 --> 00:14:12,008
Calls every day, invites to the cinema. He's nice but I don't know....What you think. Shall I go?..

152
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:21,680
Lera. Simple. If you want you go, don't want don't go. And give back the disc. .

153
00:14:21,885 --> 00:14:25,561
.If only I could know..I want or I don't want..

154
00:14:25,561 --> 00:14:26,947
Me too..

155
00:14:26,947 --> 00:14:28,731
And you what?..

156
00:14:29,015 --> 00:14:30,714
nothing..

157
00:14:31,766 --> 00:14:33,655
The rings..You bought?

158
00:14:33,655 --> 00:14:35,213
Yeah 2

159
00:14:35,213 --> 00:14:36,188
Show!

160
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:37,868
Kostia took them

161
00:14:38,103 --> 00:14:39,915
Right, you'd lose them.

162
00:14:39,915 --> 00:14:42,229
He told the same..

163
00:14:42,494 --> 00:14:44,041
Happy you are, Mashka

164
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:53,104
..Lera..They all went crazy with this wedding..Running,organizing..Mothers both making lists, bouquets..

165
00:14:53,104 --> 00:14:59,157
Oh, at the wedding aim at me with your bouquet!

166
00:15:00,028 --> 00:15:00,920
People meet..

167
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,005
People fall in love..Get married..

168
00:15:04,215 --> 00:15:17,203
And for example..if there existed not only two sexes but all five! And to survive they would need to come all together. 1 got ill, 2nd is late, 3rg lost his way, 4th simply changed his mind,

169
00:15:17,203 --> 00:15:24,047
and it turns out that for love only the 5th is ready. And what can he do, alone?

170
00:15:24,562 --> 00:15:38,064
How cool it is as a result that there are only men and women. To those who are in love devoted..

171
00:16:01,165 --> 00:16:05,270
Hello, why so late? I work till 7.

172
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:11,003
Here is the dismission paper, I need you to sign it.

173
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:18,164
Which dismission? I will not sign anything like that!

174
00:16:18,164 --> 00:16:21,066
I don't have people to work. Who is going to work? Pushkin?...

175
00:16:21,066 --> 00:16:30,182
I don't know anything..

176
00:16:30,182 --> 00:16:33,114
For the reason of changing for a new job..Which job?

177
00:16:33,316 --> 00:16:34,693
I'm leaving the country..

178
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:44,394
No I will not sign it..

179
00:16:45,993 --> 00:16:49,896
I'm an architect, I can not all my life clean the streets.

180
00:16:50,097 --> 00:16:52,411
And what! I studied in the SeaFlot Institute!

181
00:16:52,411 --> 00:17:03,105
Tatiana Petrovna, I have the last argument..

182
00:17:03,317 --> 00:17:12,694

Welcome very much

185
00:17:23,568 --> 00:17:28,491
And me I'm proud that I'm a cleaner..A cleaner is a not a human or what?

186
00:17:28,491 --> 00:17:29,650
A humain..

187
00:17:29,896 --> 00:17:37,084
Okay..Run..Run, just don't fall!

188
00:18:41,733 --> 00:18:45,031
Sorry, you are Masha?..

189
00:18:46,977 --> 00:18:47,199
Sorry I got mistaken..

190
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:16,979
You must understand Miss Emelianova..This is a commercial step. Thanks to you, we will lose everything..!

191
00:19:17,231 --> 00:19:20,433
This is the last precaution to you! Go now!

192
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:24,571
And stop being late for your job!...

193
00:19:28,513 --> 00:19:30,573
Nothing new..As always..

194
00:19:35,026 --> 00:19:41,510
Give me ur hand.

195
00:19:41,746 --> 00:19:43,611
Make a simple face..

196
00:19:43,611 --> 00:19:48,277
Simplier..

197
00:19:48,277 --> 00:20:02,888
Even simplier..

198
00:20:06,574 --> 00:20:07,934
Easier now?

199
00:20:07,934 --> 00:20:08,764
Yup

200
00:20:09,185 --> 00:20:10,136
That's cool..

201
00:20:10,358 --> 00:20:12,121
Listen, what time is it now?..

202
00:20:49,826 --> 00:20:50,951
Sorry, just your jacket..

203
00:20:52,443 --> 00:20:54,825
Why jacket? You want without jacket?

204
00:20:55,139 --> 00:20:58,201

205
00:24:09,911 --> 00:24:10,693

You want some tea?..

209
00:24:19,181 --> 00:24:23,787
Trying to find my pictures in your garbage...

210
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:33,914
Tell ,why did you bring all these strange streetsigns? I don't understand..

211
00:24:34,697 --> 00:24:38,147
Where have you been?

212
00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:39,695
At work.

213
00:24:39,977 --> 00:24:43,259
Was it difficult to call?

214
00:24:43,513 --> 00:24:45,291
Not difficult..

215
00:24:47,725 --> 00:24:54,162
I prepared dinner. Waiting for you..

216
00:24:54,515 --> 00:24:57,759

217
00:24:57,966 --> 00:25:00,461
Yes I've heard.

218
00:25:01,477 --> 00:25:03,399
I don't hear the congratulations.

219
00:25:04,477 --> 00:25:09,696
I'm very happy for you..Germany..is cool..

220
00:25:12,671 --> 00:25:19,300
Simply..I'm so tense and busy now..

221
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,926
Head breaking..

222
00:25:20,926 --> 00:25:22,332
Something happened?

223
00:25:22,332 --> 00:25:23,691
No, nothing happened..

224
00:25:23,691 --> 00:25:28,018
I'm getting married that's maybe why..You didn't know?

225
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:32,378
No..

226
00:25:32,815 --> 00:25:39,769
So that's clear..married..

227
00:25:40,847 --> 00:25:42,864
How was the work?

228
00:25:43,131 --> 00:25:44,571
Good..

229
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,565
And in details..?

230
00:25:49,412 --> 00:25:51,239
..Can I keep silence..Kostia..

231
00:25:51,458 --> 00:25:53,256
I got tired of speaking at work.

232
00:25:54,817 --> 00:26:05,053
Taste the food..Mm..delicious..Taste..

233
00:26:09,504 --> 00:26:13,426
I'm really not hungry..

234
00:26:13,426 --> 00:26:16,963
Something wrong Masha?

235
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:29,974
You need to go..?

236
00:26:30,178 --> 00:26:33,491

Maxim, sorry.

246
00:28:45,277 --> 00:28:47,229
You seemed not to wait till the end for me..

247
00:28:47,714 --> 00:28:49,418
I waited for one hour..

248
00:28:49,855 --> 00:28:51,575
I was overheld at work..

249
00:28:52,652 --> 00:28:54,341
You could also call

250
00:28:54,605 --> 00:28:57,183
..Sorry..I'll try not to be late anymore.

251
00:28:57,999 --> 00:29:00,212

252
00:29:00,212 --> 00:29:02,280

255
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:09,105
Don't know..Fashionable now..

256
00:29:09,755 --> 00:29:11,780
I called at the wrong moment?

257
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,889
It's ok.

258
00:29:13,215 --> 00:29:17,605
You have a such a voice..No..simply all fell on me also..

259
00:29:18,216 --> 00:29:20,013

260
00:29:20,013 --> 00:29:21,079

261
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:22,467

In Berlin it's nice they say.

264
00:29:30,372 --> 00:29:33,389
I'm not bad here also.

265
00:29:33,389 --> 00:29:35,577
So why you go then?

266
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:42,732
Don't know..didn't decide yet. Try to throw the coin. One side yes one side no..

267
00:29:42,936 --> 00:29:43,577
Masha..

268
00:29:45,491 --> 00:29:47,593

00:46:42,885 --> 00:46:45,817
Hello, something happened?

360
00:46:46,176 --> 00:46:52,524
Mr., you got dismissed from your job and why you are not leaving the flat?

361
00:46:53,052 --> 00:46:55,043
I am going..Is it urgent?

362
00:46:55,427 --> 00:46:58,086
Very urgent. Very..

363
00:46:59,179 --> 00:47:06,553
I just wanted to ask ..Maybe to wait..one week or two?

364
00:47:07,694 --> 00:47:17,900
You seem not to understand..Tomorrow we are going to do inventarisation here and the day after tomorrow our new worker moves in. You must understand..It's not just my wish..

365
00:47:19,053 --> 00:47:24,819
I understand..

366
00:47:26,226 --> 00:47:34,706
No you don't..Tomorrow we don't work..So we must fill this list today..

367
00:47:36,523 --> 00:47:41,208
How to fill it in? Which place to mention?..Where is he from?

368
00:47:41,424 --> 00:47:43,946
I'm from Nizhnii Novgorod. Wait..

369
00:47:45,377 --> 00:47:50,644
What wait..You understand that the passport office works only till 6 today, so we have time to sigh you out..Do we?

370
00:47:50,893 --> 00:47:53,566
So pack your things, give your keys..

371
00:47:53,566 --> 00:47:56,050
I am leaving on Monday,

372
00:47:56,572 --> 00:47:58,848
Where I'm going to live till then?

373
00:47:59,113 --> 00:48:01,126
..And about this I don't care at all

374
00:48:02,051 --> 00:48:11,450
..Okay..Okay..i don't sign anything.

375
00:48:11,784 --> 00:48:17,523
I don't have any place to go. Will sit here till Monday.

376
00:48:20,643 --> 00:48:28,582
Eh, don't bull! We speak kindly with him, and he's bulling!

377
00:48:28,807 --> 00:48:33,161
Sign! ..So we are going to use the hands..??

378
00:48:36,067 --> 00:48:40,817
Ah! You say you will sit until Monday, you WILL sit, be sure!

379
00:48:42,738 --> 00:48:48,911
Such a pig's mess 've made in the flat. What a shame!

380
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:08,414
The sun came out and I've got a feeling that the population of the city increased by 3 times as minimum.

381
00:49:08,803 --> 00:49:12,458
The statistics say in Piter there live about 6 mln people.

382
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:16,396
Personally I saw today for sure 18 mln. So many people..

383
00:49:16,616 --> 00:49:21,897
And the one needed, the only one, is lost again.

384
00:49:22,788 --> 00:49:30,740
The sponsor of our programme is the Ritual Service 'Way to Yourself'. The wonderful solution of all your problems. Haha..

385
00:49:31,007 --> 00:49:34,164
They dig deep ah..Superslogan.

386
00:49:34,524 --> 00:49:35,708
See you in a moment.

387
00:49:38,279 --> 00:49:43,763
You are crazy?!You imagine what's going to happen now?

388
00:49:45,462 --> 00:49:51,604
..Hello, Emelianova! Now now stop this horror, immediately!

389
00:49:57,743 --> 00:50:01,632
Sorry, is it possible to arrange it all quickly? I'm really in a hurry.

390
00:50:01,904 --> 00:50:10,398
..What does your 'quicker' mean..quicker than in 15 days doesn't come already. Fight..with insulting the administration..

391
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:15,603
It can hardly be called a fight.. There are witnesses..You are going abroad..

392
00:50:16,228 --> 00:50:19,806
Yes, this is the contract, I'm an architect.

393
00:50:20,091 --> 00:50:22,821
And in the working paper it's written a street-cleaner.

394
00:50:23,056 --> 00:50:26,757
And why 2 phones? Stolen?

395
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:32,087
..Why stolen..one is mine, one is of my girlfriend's.

396
00:50:46,806 --> 00:50:51,603
And where's Maxim? In the police office N8.

397
00:50:53,915 --> 00:50:55,025
And why?

398
00:50:56,776 --> 00:50:59,260
Arrested.

399
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:04,416
Masha Emelianova..Have you known him for a long time?..

400
00:51:04,839 --> 00:51:07,495
Yes, I'm his fiancée.

401
00:51:07,964 --> 00:51:10,371
And why your mobile is on him?..

402
00:51:10,371 --> 00:51:17,620
I gave it to him myself. Tell me please, when are you going to let him?

403
00:51:18,106 --> 00:51:19,792
..The court will decide..

404
00:51:20,314 --> 00:51:22,400
Which court? Wait, wait!

405
00:51:22,606 --> 00:51:24,315
Goodbye..

406
00:51:25,603 --> 00:51:29,181
Nice voice has your girlfriend..

407
00:51:37,815 --> 00:51:42,267
Hello, Petre Efimovich!

408
00:51:42,479 --> 00:51:44,341
You remember me?..

409
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:57,507
Yes of course! I really need your help, one young man got into trouble..Oh, wait.

410
00:52:10,543 --> 00:52:12,419
Good afternoon, Mr. General!

411
00:52:18,325 --> 00:52:20,089
Good afternoon Mayor.

412
00:52:34,029 --> 00:52:39,872
In your office now there is my relative, Maxim Vasiliev.

413
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:43,138
A guy hooliganned a bit..

414
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:47,468
but now realized everything ..

415
00:52:50,746 --> 00:52:52,853
You have been a Mayor long..?

416
00:52:53,624 --> 00:52:55,837

417
00:52:58,743 --> 00:53:00,900

418
00:53:03,494 --> 00:53:05,293

420
00:53:22,205 --> 00:53:23,291

00:53:24,164 --> 00:53:25,393

422
00:53:25,889 --> 00:53:28,766

423
00:53:29,448 --> 00:53:37,105

424
00:53:38,625 --> 00:53:41,626

425
00:54:23,416 --> 00:54:26,620
Thanks God. Hi, what happened?

426
00:54:26,831 --> 00:54:31,285
I'll tell you. I don't know what you told them but they let me out.

427
00:54:36,073 --> 00:54:39,433
Imagine I told the police that you are my fiancé. That's ok?

428
00:54:39,699 --> 00:54:41,779
That's terribly.pleasant.

429
00:54:44,207 --> 00:54:46,075
What are you doing? ..

430
00:54:47,763 --> 00:54:50,529
Sitting, watching the house. Beautiful? ..

431
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:53,700
No, ugly.

432
00:54:55,107 --> 00:54:57,670
You'll show it to me when we meet?

433
00:54:58,419 --> 00:55:00,404
Ok, but not today..

434
00:55:00,921 --> 00:55:03,310
Today's my farewell party.

435
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:11,045
Me too I'm working tonight. I'll call you ok?

436
00:55:11,327 --> 00:55:17,623
Ok..will be waiting..Thank you one more..

437
00:55:24,937 --> 00:55:45,085
Here you can call and share your happiness or your sadness..The next call is on..Good evening.

438
00:55:45,472 --> 00:55:49,999
How to tell a man that I don't love him anymore..

439
00:55:49,999 --> 00:55:51,862
You are sure in that?

440
00:55:52,110 --> 00:56:05,750
Yes..he's very kind and good and he loves me..But I know if I tell him he will feel bad. I'm so tensed Don't know what to do.

441
00:56:08,548 --> 00:56:10,376
..That's complicated.

442
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:15,805
I believe the most important thing is honesty.

443
00:56:22,096 --> 00:56:26,391
If you will kill me I'll understand..

444
00:56:26,679 --> 00:56:40,815
We will see..Kostia. Good that you are here. Masha is coming. Listen, she's not very ok today..

445
00:57:01,815 --> 00:57:12,319
We have some changes..From now on you are going to put one song of this disc at the end of every hour. And in the breaks you speak about the group.Here you can find everything.

446
00:57:16,613 --> 00:57:19,503
Sorry but I can not put in on air!

447
00:57:25,893 --> 00:57:36,489
You can take me out of the radio, but this is pornography, and people listen.

448
00:57:43,022 --> 00:57:48,831
No..I'm not going to take you out. All will be much simplier.

449
00:57:55,442 --> 00:57:57,083
I will close this circus.

450
00:57:58,022 --> 00:58:02,405
You finish this shift and you are fired!

451
00:58:22,615 --> 00:58:23,459
This is for you.

452
00:58:23,882 --> 00:58:25,428
Thank you..For what?

453
00:58:25,782 --> 00:58:27,177
I was wrong sorry.

454
00:58:31,444 --> 00:58:33,367
Maybe we'll not argue anymore.

455
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:46,257
Parents gave me the list of guests for approval.

456
00:58:55,709 --> 00:58:56,648
Excuse me..

457
00:58:58,885 --> 00:59:02,476
don't you remember the song of Grebenschikov about the phone?..

458
00:59:10,633 --> 00:59:11,993
No..not this!

459
00:59:21,775 --> 00:59:23,039
I told you!

460
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:49,008
Kostia.

461
00:59:49,307 --> 00:59:51,947
There will be no wedding.

462
00:59:54,797 --> 00:59:58,689
What? What the jokes!

463
01:00:05,901 --> 01:00:08,572
I did not understand..

464
01:00:10,659 --> 01:00:14,635
I can not..

465
01:00:25,995 --> 01:00:40,951
Kostia understand me please..You are very good..You are the closest person I have..

466
01:00:57,050 --> 01:01:00,153
Everything will be ok..

467
01:01:01,014 --> 01:01:06,514
Don't say silly things.

468
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:11,231
I don't love you

469
01:01:21,454 --> 01:01:23,825
Forgive me

470
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:32,107
That's all right

471
01:02:54,282 --> 01:02:58,194
One big grey metal bird

472
01:02:59,658 --> 01:03:04,970
flew flew, flew flew..and fell down!

473
01:03:05,721 --> 01:03:10,182
That's why we project houses and not the planes..

474
01:03:10,782 --> 01:03:14,133
They of course fall, but at least don't fly..

475
01:03:14,133 --> 01:03:18,221
For you Max! For your brilliant future!

476
01:03:24,987 --> 01:03:26,457
I love Piter actually..

477
01:03:26,939 --> 01:03:30,134
I hardly believe in such patriotism.

478
01:03:33,409 --> 01:03:37,721
You didn't understand why? Because of Marina..

479
01:03:38,488 --> 01:03:41,708
I'm the same believe me..You remember with Galia?

480
01:03:47,694 --> 01:03:52,909
He's so sad..Marina..The architect needs a musa.

481
01:04:12,707 --> 01:04:15,221
Ready? Recording?

482
01:05:07,110 --> 01:05:07,544
Hi..

483
01:05:08,312 --> 01:05:09,958
You have a cigarette?

484
01:05:10,203 --> 01:05:12,359
Thanks brother...

485
01:05:23,802 --> 01:05:27,218

490
01:05:49,858 --> 01:05:53,789
Right..Only problems of this vodka..

491
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:09,846
She sent me to do shopping with a list.. And today is weekend, I bought also a little vodka and a beer.

492
01:06:10,938 --> 01:06:17,601
Drank all, and put the bottles into the bag..

493
01:06:18,455 --> 01:06:22,671
and to close forgot!! And all split on this damned food..

494
01:06:25,386 --> 01:06:31,730
She made a scandal, doesn't let me in now

495
01:06:31,730 --> 01:06:33,329

496
01:06:35,824 --> 01:06:42,511

497
01:06:42,777 --> 01:06:47,879
.Eh..eh guy where are you going?..jacket!..

498
01:07:08,967 --> 01:07:10,170

499
01:07:11,622 --> 01:07:12,904

500
01:10:13,344 --> 01:10:16,115
Sorry for calling so late. Nobody called during the day?

501
01:10:16,846 --> 01:10:18,158
Nobody.

502
01:10:20,393 --> 01:10:23,970
I see..What is this sound, where are you?

503
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:25,579
..Sitting on the bridge..

504
01:10:26,032 --> 01:10:27,564
Romantics..

505
01:10:28,501 --> 01:10:29,801
Heh..

506
01:10:30,188 --> 01:10:31,471
And what is there, on the bridge?

507
01:10:32,062 --> 01:10:37,173
..On the bridge? Awfully cold, Water flowing, fog..chunky dog running..

508
01:10:38,242 --> 01:10:40,283
I want also on the bridge..

509
01:10:41,243 --> 01:10:43,658
I can reserve a place for you.

510
01:10:44,549 --> 01:10:47,814
Ah, in the afternoon some guy called..

511
01:10:50,324 --> 01:10:51,837
Kostia, maybe..

512
01:10:51,837 --> 01:10:53,034
Your fiancé?

513
01:10:57,596 --> 01:11:01,425
And when is the wedding?..

514
01:11:05,284 --> 01:11:06,612
You are crying?

515
01:11:08,549 --> 01:11:10,347
He'll call..

516
01:11:10,846 --> 01:11:11,970
Sorry..

517
01:11:12,283 --> 01:11:14,489
That's ok..Simply there will be no wedding..

518
01:11:14,768 --> 01:11:17,411
Quarelled?..

519
01:11:17,894 --> 01:11:29,770
We've been together a huge time, from school. He's good. I don't know what happened but

520
01:11:30,003 --> 01:11:39,018
I realized suddenly that I can not anymore..Told him today.

521
01:11:40,163 --> 01:11:48,646
Sorry for him..Though..Don't pity him. My girlfriend left me too, no pity. And you see, surviving somehow..

522
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:51,558
Sad..

523
01:11:51,558 --> 01:12:02,769
And what can we do..Life is in general an unexpected thing..Only in movies everything is predictable.

524
01:12:03,051 --> 01:12:05,629
..And you promised to show me the house.

525
01:12:09,351 --> 01:12:14,302
I'll show. I have a special relation with buildings.

526
01:12:14,693 --> 01:12:16,178
Which relation?

527
01:12:16,505 --> 01:12:19,100
I'm an architect..

528
01:12:26,356 --> 01:12:37,154
They all like people..Sometimes they tell you such things..can write romans from that..

529
01:12:37,154 --> 01:12:38,623
Do you write?

530
01:12:38,856 --> 01:12:40,357
No..lazy..

531
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:43,873
Piter is full of such stories..

532
01:12:44,248 --> 01:12:47,811
And you are going to leave..You decided to go?

533
01:12:48,013 --> 01:12:50,638
..Until the moment I give you the phone I'll not go don't worry..

534
01:12:50,904 --> 01:12:53,684
So, you'll have to stay for long..

535
01:12:53,919 --> 01:12:59,014
You know I didn't make up my mind yet..maybe it's better to leave.

536
01:13:00,013 --> 01:13:06,014
Threw the coin? Yes..everywhere..in both rivers..

537
01:13:13,569 --> 01:13:15,084
See you tomorrow?

538
01:13:15,285 --> 01:13:17,343
Of course.

539
01:13:17,661 --> 01:13:23,453
Strange..You have such a voice..As if I heard it many times before..

540
01:13:26,561 --> 01:13:29,751
Maybe..Good night Maxim.

541
01:13:30,063 --> 01:13:33,625
Good night Masha..

542
01:14:08,549 --> 01:14:12,172
Signed the contract? Everything is satisfying your demands?

543
01:14:15,913 --> 01:14:20,641
No..Point 27..I can not agree on that.

544
01:14:24,391 --> 01:14:28,613
Ah..you don't understand what it is forcemajor?

545
01:14:30,987 --> 01:14:36,611
This is zunami, earthquake, revolution, this is only formality..

546
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:49,611
How come..the earthquake the formality..You know that the next years there can happen plenty of zunamis, as Naustradamus saw..No, I can not work in such conditions.

547
01:14:51,239 --> 01:14:54,239
I'm asking you..This is the standard point of every contract..

548
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:59,548
I'm begging you. Come in a couple of days..Think everything over..

549
01:15:01,175 --> 01:15:09,862
I will not sign this contract , BUT I can recommend you a very good architect, Fedor Zemtsov.

550
01:15:10,081 --> 01:15:12,488
I'll write his number to you.

551
01:15:12,791 --> 01:15:15,691
Call him please, he is a very talented young architect.

552
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:17,068
And what is very important

553
01:15:17,396 --> 01:15:20,884
he is not afraid neither of zunami, nor of earthquakes, nor of revolutions.

554
01:15:22,210 --> 01:15:25,277
Listen, this radio killer called you himself?

555
01:15:25,759 --> 01:15:27,154
..Yeah..

556
01:15:27,582 --> 01:15:33,151
Haha I beg he is not indifferent to you..

557
01:15:33,931 --> 01:15:35,505
Wait a second.

558
01:15:46,329 --> 01:15:50,449
I'll tell you by secret, that broadcasters promise rain today..

559
01:15:50,925 --> 01:15:54,302
though..who belives broadcasters nowadays..

560
01:15:54,731 --> 01:16:02,451
On the other hand..why the rain is bad..Maybe it's even better..

561
01:18:26,482 --> 01:18:29,029
Hi Masha! Very glad to hear you!

562
01:18:33,263 --> 01:18:36,685
Yeah I'd like to meet you very much too. Let's meet today.

563
01:18:39,634 --> 01:18:48,637
Listen, let me have your number 'cause your battery is running out..

564
01:20:05,453 --> 01:20:06,889
Good afternoon..

565
01:20:07,139 --> 01:20:13,487
Good afternoon I would like to leave a message for a girl named Masha, in a red jacket who lost her phone..

566
01:20:13,702 --> 01:20:16,406
Maxim, is it you..?
