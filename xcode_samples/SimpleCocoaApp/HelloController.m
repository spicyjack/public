// This method is called when the user picks a different message 
// to display by clicking a different radio button
- (IBAction)switchMessage:(id)sender
{
	// sender is the NSMatrix containing the radio buttons.
	// We ask the sender for which row (radio button) is selected and add one
	// to compensate for counting from zero.
	int which = [sender selectedRow] + 1;
	
	// We now set our NSButton's action to be the message corresponding to the radio button selection.
	// +[NSString stringWithFormat:...] is used to concatenate "message" and the message number.  
	// NSSelectorFromString converts the message name string to an actual message structure that
	// Objective-C can use.
	[helloButton setAction:NSSelectorFromString([NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@%d:", @"message", which])];

// This method is called when the user picks a different object to 
// receive messages using the PopUp menu
- (IBAction)switchObject:(id)sender
{
	// sender is the NSPopUpMenu containing Hello object choices.
	// We ask the sender for which menu item is selected and add one
	// to compensate for counting from zero.
	int which = [sender indexOfSelectedItem] + 1;

	// Based on which menu item is selected, we set the target (the receiving object)
	// of the helloButton to point to either hello1 or hello2.
	if (which == 1)

// at this point, we can do any needed initialization before turning app control over to the user
- (void)awakeFromNib

}

// Handling the Help menu:
// -----------------------
// It used to be that we had a routine here that opened our ReadMe.html help file using Help Viewer via
// NSWorkspace's -openFile:withApplication:, but now we do things the "modern" way.  This means that we
// let Cocoa handle things automatically for us.  The only thing we need is a folder containing our help
// files that sits in the Resources folder inside the SimpleCocoaApp bundle, a new meta tag in our help title
// page (the "AppleTitle" tag), and a few Info.plist keys (see the "Expert" view of Targets -> Application Settings).
// The two Info.plist keys needed are CFBundleHelpBookFolder and CFBundleHelpBookName.  Once that is done,
// Help Viewer will automatically open the Help page when the Help menu item is selected, etc.  No code is needed!
