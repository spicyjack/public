## Basics of the iOS App Testing/Release Workflow ##
- Create Certificate Signing Request for a developer certificate; upload your
  certificate to: https://developer.apple.com/ios/manage/overview/index.action
- Add your testing device ID at
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/manage/devices/index.action
  - Get the device ID either in Xcode in the Organizer, or under iTunes, on
    the device summary screen, click on the Serial number label, which will
    then change to show the device ID
- Create an "App ID" at:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/manage/bundles/index.action
  When creating the App ID, you can put anything in the description field, but
  the Bundle Identifier needs to match what Xcode is using in the Bundle
  Identifier field of the project file.
- Create a "provisioning profile" at: 
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/manage/provisioningprofiles/index.action
  The provisioning profile uses your developer certificate, the device ID, and
  the App ID in order to create a unique identifier that will be used when
  compiling the app in Xcode.  Once you request the provisioning profile, it
  will take a minute or two before you can download it.  Once you download it,
  double click on it or drag it on the Xcode icon to add it to Xcode
